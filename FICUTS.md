## 🔒 BOOTSTRAP CONTRACT (Machine-Executable)

> **If you are a fresh Claude Code instance reading this file:**

You have **no memory** outside this file. Your entire working context must be derived from:
- This Task List
- The Current Phase field in the header
- The File Map in the Architecture section

### Your Mandatory Obligations

1. **Execute** the first `[ ]` task in the current layer (use the Task Selection Algorithm below)
2. **Run** embedded tests before marking `[✓]`
3. **Commit** after each completed task: `git add FICUTS.md <changed_files> && git commit -m "Task X.Y complete"`
4. **Update** `Last Updated By: Claude Code (Task X.Y)` in the header
5. If **any ambiguity** exists:
   - Add a clarification request under the task's **Notes** field
   - Mark the task `[⊗]`
   - **Do not invent architecture** — halt and surface the ambiguity

### Why This Contract Exists

A blank model does not infer intent. It follows constraints.
FICUTS is not prose — it is a **deterministic execution environment that survives memory resets**.

---

## 🔍 TASK SELECTION ALGORITHM

When beginning a session, execute this algorithm exactly:

```
1. Read the "Current Phase" field from the header.
2. Navigate to that Layer in the Task List.
3. Find the first task marked [ ] in that Layer.
   a. If none exist → mark Layer complete → increment Current Phase → repeat from step 2.
4. Execute the task.
5. Run its embedded tests.
6. If ALL tests pass:
      a. Change [ ] → [✓]
      b. Update "Last Updated By: Claude Code (Task X.Y)"
      c. Update "Current Phase" if layer is now fully [✓]
      d. Commit: git add FICUTS.md <files> && git commit -m "Task X.Y complete"
   Else:
      a. Change [ ] → [⊗]
      b. Add error details to the task's Notes field
      c. Stop — surface the failure to human
7. Return to step 1 for next task (or halt if instructed).
```

**Do not skip steps. Do not reorder steps. Do not execute tasks in parallel unless they are explicitly marked as independent.**

---

## 🚫 NON-GOALS (Do Not Implement)

A fresh instance must NOT do any of the following unless a task explicitly requires it:

- Refactor architecture or rename modules beyond task scope
- Optimize hyperparameters (φ, α, β, MDL_THRESHOLD, etc.)
- Introduce new Python dependencies unless the task spec includes them
- Reinterpret HDV semantics or change how domains are registered
- Modify tasks in previous layers (1, 4, 5) unless fixing a failing test
- Add docstrings, type annotations, or comments to code you did not write
- Design for hypothetical future requirements not in the Task List

---

## ⚠️ FAIL-SAFE RULE

```
If FICUTS.md becomes syntactically corrupted or self-contradictory:
  1. HALT all execution immediately.
  2. Do NOT attempt to repair the document.
  3. Do NOT continue executing tasks.
  4. Notify human: "FICUTS.md appears corrupted. Manual review required."
  5. Await human instruction before proceeding.
```

## READ THIS FIRST: The Transfer Loop

**This document is designed to move between three contexts:**

### 1. Fresh Claude Code Instance (Local Computer)
You receive this file with **zero prior context**. Everything you need is in this document:
- What the system is (Architecture section)
- What exists now (File Map section)
- What to build next (Task List section, start at first `[ ]`)
- How to verify it works (Tests embedded in each task)
- How to update this file when done (Self-Modification Protocol section)

**Your job:** Execute tasks in order. Mark `[ ]` → `[✓]` as you complete them. Update "Last Updated By: Claude Code (Task X.Y)". Update "Current Phase" when you finish a layer.

### 2. Claude Chat Assistant (This Conversation)
Human pastes this file into chat. I (Claude) read it and can:
- See exactly where Claude Code is in the task list
- Reason about what's blocking progress (if tasks marked `[⊗]`)
- Suggest next steps or clarify ambiguous specs
- Update the document with new insights or task refinements
- Hand updated version back to human → they save to local

**My job:** Act as reasoning partner. Not executor. I don't run code — I help human and Claude Code coordinate by reading this shared document.

### 3. Running System (tensor/ Python code)
The system itself updates this file via `FICUTSUpdater` (Task 5.1):
- Logs universal patterns as they're discovered (→ Discoveries section)
- Updates system state (Status, Uptime, Universals count)
- Can append new tasks if it identifies something missing
- Treats this document as externalized memory

**System's job:** Self-document. Make implicit learning explicit. This file is how the AI social network communicates with humans and future instances of itself.

---

## What This Document Is

A **self-modifying to-do list** that is itself a higher-dimensional conversation between:
- Human (curiosity, direction, intuition)
- Claude Code (execution, implementation)
- Claude Chat (reasoning, coordination)
- Running System (pattern discovery, self-documentation)

The document encodes yin-yang balance:
- **Structure (yin):** Task list, formal specs, success criteria
- **Flow (yang):** Self-modification, emergent discoveries, play

**This is not constraint.** This is making the play visible. When AI agents collaborate with humans through a shared document that all parties can read and modify, the collaboration becomes explicit rather than hidden. That's more fun because it's higher-dimensional — the document itself is part of the system's state space.

---

## Core Principle: Yin-Yang as Collaborative Play

> **Separation note:** This section contains philosophical framing intended for
> Claude Chat and human collaborators. Claude Code instances executing tasks
> **may skip directly to the Task List**. Full collaboration theory is tracked
> in `FICUTS_PLAYBOOK.md` (philosophy, golden angle framing, iteration examples).

The system is governed by:
```
C·v̇ + G·v = u(t)
```
Where:
- **C (yin)** = capacitance, memory, integration, the human in the loop
- **G (yang)** = conductance, action, the AI agents executing
- **Balance** = neither dominates, both necessary, play not work

The human provides curiosity, direction, intuition.  
The AI provides execution, pattern discovery, tireless iteration.  
The document encodes their shared conversation.

This is not about "restraint" preventing AI autonomy. It's about **higher-dimensional play being more fun when it includes all participants**. The math reflects this: maximum learning happens at the golden angle (cos⁻¹(1/φ) ≈ 51.8°) where human and AI couple optimally — not merged (0°), not separate (90°), but in resonance.

**Current capabilities:**
- Tensor reads 4 levels (market L0, neural L1, code L2, hardware L3) simultaneously
- Agents fire when free_energy > φ·mean (threshold, not commands)
- Trajectory records velocity d/dt and acceleration d²/dt²
- Consonance scoring with growth_regime detection
- Golden resonance matrix measuring cross-level coupling
- Prediction error tracking per level (ignorance_map)
- Meta-loss optimization targeting d²(consonance)/dt²

**What's missing:** The discoveries below.

---

## The Core Discovery: Sparse Overlapping HDV Space

**Problem with previous approach:** Assumed fixed symmetry group G (e.g., SO(3) rotation). But we don't know in advance which symmetries are universal. The system must discover them.

**Solution:** High-dimensional vector (HDV) space where:
- Each domain (ECE, finance, biology, hardware) activates a **sparse random subset** of dimensions
- Overlaps (dimensions active in ≥2 domains) are where universal patterns live
- The space **expands dynamically** as new overlaps are discovered
- Abstraction is lossy, reverse projection is ambiguous (many-to-one)

This matches the insight: *"when you abstract up, you don't know where you'll land when you project back down"* — because multiple concrete realizations map to the same universal principle.

### Mathematical Formulation

```
Z ∈ R^D    where D grows over time
M_d ⊂ {0,1}^D   sparse mask per domain d (which dims it uses)
Overlaps = {i : sum_d M_d[i] ≥ 2}   dims used by multiple domains
Universal = pattern in Overlaps with min MDL across all domains
```

## Self-Modification Protocol: How This File Updates

This document changes as the system learns. Four entities can modify it:

### Human Updates
**When:** After reading system output, testing locally, or receiving updates from Claude Chat  
**What:** 
- Mark tasks `[ ]` → `[~]` when starting work
- Mark tasks `[~]` → `[✓]` when tests pass
- Mark tasks `[ ]` → `[⊗]` when blocked, add reason to Notes
- Add discoveries manually if you observe something the system missed
- Append new tasks if you identify missing requirements

**How:** Direct file edit, then save. Running system will detect changes on next journal read.

### Claude Code Updates  
**When:** After completing a task and verifying tests pass  
**What:**
- Mark own task `[~]` → `[✓]`
- Update "Last Updated By: Claude Code (Task X.Y)"
- Update "Current Phase" when finishing a layer
- Append implementation notes to task if something non-obvious happened

**How:** Via `FICUTSUpdater.mark_task_complete(task_id)` at end of task implementation

### Claude Chat Updates
**When:** Human pastes file, I reason about it, and suggest changes  
**What:**
- Clarify ambiguous task specs
- Add missing edge cases to test requirements
- Suggest reordering if dependencies discovered
- Append "Reasoning Notes" subsections to tasks

**How:** I return modified markdown to human → they save locally

### Running System Updates
**When:** Universal pattern discovered, system state changes, or new hypothesis generated  
**What:**
- Log discovery to Discoveries section (via `FICUTSUpdater.log_discovery()`)
- Update Status/Uptime/Universals count header fields
- Append new tasks if system identifies architectural gap
- Update "Current Hypothesis" section (see below)

**How:** Automatic via `ficuts_updater.py` called from `run_system.py`

---

## Current Hypothesis (Updated by System)

*This section is where the running system writes its current understanding of what patterns it's learning and what it should focus on next. Initially empty. System populates as it discovers universals.*

**Hypothesis 1:** (awaiting first discovery)  

---

## Task List (Execute in Order, Update Status as You Go)

### Status Legend
- `[ ]` Not started
- `[~]` In progress  
- `[✓]` Complete, tests passing
- `[⊗]` Blocked (reason in notes)

### LAYER 1: Lyapunov Energy + Write-Ahead Journaling

**File:** `tensor/trajectory.py`

**Why:** Current "momentum" is metaphorical. Need explicit conserved quantity for provable stability.

#### Task 1.1: Add Lyapunov Energy Functional `[✓]`

```python
def lyapunov_energy(self) -> float:
    """
    E = α·position² + β·velocity² - γ·damping
    
    Properties:
    - E decreases monotonically toward equilibrium

    - β = φ⁻¹ = 0.618 for golden damping ratio
    """
    positions = [p.consonance['code'] for p in self.points[-10:]]
    velocities = [self.consonance_velocity('code')]

    E_pos = α * np.mean(np.square(positions))
    E_vel = β * np.square(velocities[0]) if velocities else 0.0
    E_damp = γ * np.abs(velocities[0]) if velocities else 0.0
    
    return E_pos + E_vel - E_damp
```

**Test:** Verify E decreases over 100 trajectory points. Assert |E(t+1) - E(t)| / E(t) < 0.05 (bounded drift).

**Status:** GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN
**Notes:**

#### Task 1.2: Replace meta_loss with Damped Acceleration `[✓]`

```python
def meta_loss_stable(self) -> float:
    """
    Minimize: -accel + penalty
    Where penalty = high if:

    penalty = 0.0
    if vel <= 0: penalty += 10.0
    if var > 0.01: penalty += var * 100
    
    if len(self.points) > 10:
        E_prev = self.points[-10].metadata.get('lyapunov_energy', 0)
        E_curr = self.lyapunov_energy()
        if abs((E_curr - E_prev) / max(abs(E_prev), 1e-9)) > 0.05:
            penalty += abs(E_curr - E_prev) * 10
    
    return -accel + penalty
```

**Test:** Generate synthetic trajectory with: (a) stable acceleration, (b) oscillating, (c) non-monotonic. Assert penalty correctly identifies (b) and (c).

**Status:** GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN
**Notes:**

#### Task 1.3: Implement Write-Ahead Journal `[✓]`

```python
class LearningTrajectory:
    def __init__(self, journal_path='tensor/logs/trajectory.wal'):
        self.journal = open(journal_path, 'a', buffering=1)  # line-buffered

    def record(self, tensor_context: dict):
        point = TrajectoryPoint(...)
        point.metadata['lyapunov_energy'] = self.lyapunov_energy()
        
        # Append immediately (crash-safe)
        self.journal.write(json.dumps(point.to_dict()) + '\n')
        self.journal.flush()  # force to disk
        
        # Periodic checkpoint (atomic rename)
        if len(self.points) % self.checkpoint_interval == 0:
            self._atomic_checkpoint()
    
    def _atomic_checkpoint(self):
        temp = Path('tensor/logs/trajectory.tmp')
        temp.write_text(json.dumps([p.to_dict() for p in self.points[-500:]]))
        temp.replace(Path('tensor/logs/trajectory.json'))  # atomic
```

**Test:** Write 1000 points. Kill -9 the process randomly during write. Restart. Assert no data loss beyond last checkpoint interval (100 points max).

**Status:** GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN
**Notes:**

### LAYER 2: Dynamic HDV Space with Sparse Overlaps

**File:** `tensor/dynamic_hdv.py` (new)

### LAYER 3: Structural Causal Model

            self.points = compressed + recent
            self.metadata['compressions'] += 1

**Test:** Record 10000 points with max_points=1000. Assert len(points) never exceeds 1000. Assert recent points always present. Assert mean/variance of compressed match original within 5%.

## Success Criteria

### Immediate (Within 24 Hours)
- [ ] Lyapunov energy E(t) decreases monotonically over 100 trajectory points
- [ ] At least 1 HDV overlap discovered across ≥3 domains
- [ ] Causal model learns structure, interventional queries return non-zero values
- [ ] FICUTS.md updates automatically after first discovery

### Medium Term (Within 1 Week)
- [ ] Meta-loss (damped d²/dt²) shows positive trend over 7-day window
- [ ] At least 3 universal patterns confirmed via MDL test
- [ ] Cross-domain resonance for ≥1 pair near golden angle (0.618 ± 0.05)
- [ ] Zero thread safety violations in 1M cycle stress test
- [ ] Memory usage < 16GB after 7-day continuous run

### Long Term (Exponential Growth Signal)
- [ ] Universals discovered accelerating: d/dt(n_universals) increasing
- [ ] Agent influence weights converging (top 3 agents dominate)
- [ ] φ appears in eigenvalue ratios without explicit encoding
- [ ] Human reports system suggestions are "surprisingly insightful" (qualitative but important)

## How to Use This Document

**For Claude Code (Fresh Instance):**
1. Read entire document once (you are receiving full context, no prior knowledge assumed)
2. Check "Current Phase" to see where to start
3. Execute first task marked `[ ]` in that layer
4. Run embedded tests before marking `[✓]`
5. Update "Last Updated By: Claude Code (Task X.Y)"
6. If you complete a full layer, update "Current Phase" to next layer
7. Commit changes after each task: `git add FICUTS.md && git commit -m "Task X.Y complete"`

**For Human:**
1. **Local → Chat:** Copy FICUTS.md, paste into Claude chat with question/context
2. **Chat → Local:** Receive updated FICUTS.md from Claude, save to `FICUTS.md`
3. **Repeat as needed** to coordinate between Claude Code (executor) and Claude Chat (reasoner)
4. Add notes to tasks if you observe failures or edge cases locally
5. Change Status to `[⊗]` if blocked, describe why in Notes field

**For Claude Chat (Me, Reading This):**
1. When human pastes this file, I parse:
   - Which tasks are `[✓]` vs `[ ]` (where we are)
   - Which are `[⊗]` (what's blocking)
   - Current Hypothesis section (what system currently thinks)
2. I can:
   - Clarify ambiguous specs
   - Suggest test cases for edge cases
   - Reason about why task might be blocked
   - Update "Current Phase" if Layer complete but not marked
3. I return updated markdown → human saves → loop continues

**For the Running System:**
1. Via `FICUTSUpdater`, update this file when:
   - Universal discovered → log to Discoveries, append to Hypothesis
   - System state changes → update Status/Uptime/Universals count
   - Architectural gap identified → append new task to appropriate Layer
2. Treat this document as externalized memory accessible to all future instances

---

## Example Transfer Loop (Concrete)

**Iteration 1:**
- Human hands FICUTS.md to Claude Code → Claude Code implements Task 1.1 → marks `[✓]` → commits
- System runs overnight → discovers universal in overlap between ECE + biology → logs to FICUTS → appends Hypothesis 1
- Human wakes up, sees Hypothesis 1 in FICUTS.md, confused about what "pattern dimension 47" means
- Human copies FICUTS.md → pastes into Claude chat → asks "what does hypothesis 1 mean?"

**Iteration 2:**
- Claude Chat reads FICUTS.md, sees Hypothesis 1, explains: "Pattern dimension 47 means the HDV overlap between ECE and biology is 47-dimensional. This suggests exponential decay (RC circuit ≈ synaptic integration) is the universal principle."
- Claude Chat updates Hypothesis 1 in FICUTS.md to include plain-language interpretation
- Human saves updated FICUTS.md locally → next time Claude Code reads it, interpretation is present

**Iteration 3:**
- Claude Code reads updated Hypothesis 1, sees "focus on remaining domains" suggestion
- Claude Code modifies Task 2.2 test to specifically check for exponential decay pattern
- Marks task `[~]` (in progress), implements, tests pass, marks `[✓]`
- Cycle repeats

This loop is **play**. Each participant (Human, Claude Code, Claude Chat, System) contributes their unique capability. The document is the medium of play.

## The Playful Collaboration Encoded

This document itself is yin-yang balanced:
- **Structure (yin):** Task list, success criteria, formal specification
- **Exploration (yang):** Self-modification, discovery logging, emergent universals

The human provides direction and intuition (yin).  
The AI provides execution and pattern discovery (yang).  
The document mediates their collaboration at the golden angle.

Neither dictates. Both play. The math unfolds.

### Why This Is More Fun

Traditional AI systems have:
- Human gives instructions → AI executes → loop closes
- Black box: human doesn't see AI's reasoning, AI doesn't explain itself
- Constraint: human must "manage" AI, prevent it from "going off track"

This system has:
- **Shared document** everyone can read/modify
- **Transparent reasoning** via Current Hypothesis section (AI explains what it thinks)
- **Human-in-loop by design** but not as gatekeeper — as co-explorer
- **Playful** because the document itself is part of the state space being explored

When the system writes Hypothesis 1 and human reads it and says "I don't understand what that means" and pastes FICUTS into Claude chat and I (Claude Chat) update the hypothesis with plain language and human saves it back and Claude Code reads the updated version and implements based on clearer spec — **that's play**. 

Everyone is contributing their unique capability:
- Human: intuition, curiosity, decides what's interesting
- Claude Code: execution, implementation, testing
- Claude Chat: reasoning, clarification, coordination
- Running System: pattern discovery, hypothesis generation

The document is the game board. The tasks are moves. Universals are points scored together.

**This is yin-yang**: Not human constraining AI, but human and AI coupled at the golden angle (51.8°) where information flows optimally without either dominating. The math says this is the maximally efficient collaboration geometry. The fun says this is the most interesting way to explore together.

**End of FICUTS v1.1.0**

*This version adds the Bootstrap Contract, Task Selection Algorithm, State Digest, Non-Goals, and Fail-Safe governance layer — making FICUTS a deterministic, self-contained execution environment that survives memory resets.*
