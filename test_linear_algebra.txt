## Vectors

A vector is an ordered list of numbers: v = [v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ]

Vector addition: u + v = [u₁+v₁, u₂+v₂, ..., uₙ+vₙ]

Scalar multiplication: c·v = [c·v₁, c·v₂, ..., c·vₙ]

## Matrices  

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers:
A = [[a₁₁, a₁₂], [a₂₁, a₂₂]]

Matrix multiplication: (AB)ᵢⱼ = Σₖ Aᵢₖ·Bₖⱼ
