ABSTRACT
================================================================================

Simulation of dynamical systems -- physical, computational, and engineered --
requires repeated numerical integration of differential equations, with cost
scaling poorly to large systems and parameter sweeps.  This invention discloses
a platform method for eliminating redundant computation across structurally
similar dynamical systems.

The core insight is that a broad class of oscillatory systems -- including RLC
circuits, mechanical oscillators, power grid generators, gradient-descent
optimizers, and nonlinear oscillators -- share a universal three-dimensional
invariant embedding: (log_omega0_norm, log_Q_norm, zeta), where omega_0 is the
linearized natural frequency, Q is the quality factor, and zeta is the damping
ratio.  Systems that are close in this invariant space exhibit similar spectral
structure, regardless of their physical domain.

The invention provides:
  (1) a domain-agnostic method for extracting the invariant triple from any
      oscillatory system, via linearization or Extended Dynamic Mode
      Decomposition (EDMD) for nonlinear systems;
  (2) a regime-memory database storing precomputed spectral data (eigenvalues,
      stability margins, modal structure) keyed by invariant signature;
  (3) a retrieval mechanism that identifies the nearest stored regime for a new
      system and uses its spectral data to initialize or warm-start a solver;
  (4) cross-domain transfer: regime memories from one physical domain (e.g.,
      RLC circuits) are reused to accelerate solvers in a structurally similar
      but physically distinct domain (e.g., power grid generators).

Validated across five physical domains: RLC circuits, spring-mass-damper
systems, power grid generators (IEEE 39-bus, 10 machines), nonlinear Duffing
oscillators, and gradient-descent optimization dynamics.  Demonstrated results:
  - 2,708x speedup via regime warm-start versus cold-start solver
  - 3.7x cross-domain transfer improvement (spring-mass regimes seeding RLC)
  - Universal correction scalar cross-validated at CV = 0.66% across IEEE 39-bus

The platform enables a single regime library, built offline from any domain,
to accelerate simulation across all domains sharing the invariant structure.

================================================================================
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
================================================================================

This invention relates to computer-implemented simulation of dynamical systems,
specifically to methods for indexing systems by invariant spectral signatures,
storing and retrieving precomputed regime data, and using retrieved spectral
predictions to initialize numerical solvers -- enabling cross-domain reuse of
computational results without re-solving systems from scratch.

================================================================================
BACKGROUND
================================================================================

A. The Redundancy Problem in Dynamical System Simulation

Simulation of dynamical systems is a dominant computational cost across
science, engineering, and optimization.  Standard approaches -- Runge-Kutta
integration, finite element methods, iterative eigensolvers -- treat each
system independently, discarding the computational work after each solve.

Yet most simulation workloads are highly structured.  An engineer sweeping
RLC circuit parameters across a frequency range, a grid operator screening
N-1 contingencies, or a machine learning practitioner tuning optimizer
hyperparameters all encounter systems that are structurally similar to
previously solved cases.  No existing method systematically reuses spectral
information across these structurally similar instances.

B. Prior Approaches and Limitations

Model order reduction (ROM) and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) reduce
computational cost by building a reduced basis from snapshots of a given
system.  These methods are system-specific: a basis built for an RLC circuit
provides no benefit to a power grid simulator.

Neural operator methods (DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator) learn solution
maps for a parameterized PDE family.  These require training data from the
target domain and do not exploit structural similarity across physically
distinct domains.

Transfer learning for dynamical systems typically requires fine-tuning on
target-domain data, not zero-shot warm-start from invariant retrieval.

No prior method provides a domain-agnostic invariant index that enables
spectral reuse across physically distinct systems.

C. The Invariant Structure Gap

It has been known since the early 20th century that many physical systems
share the same governing equations up to parameter relabeling: an RLC circuit
is isomorphic to a spring-mass-damper at the equation level.  However, this
isomorphism has not been systematically exploited as a computational tool for
cross-domain solver acceleration.

This invention formalizes the isomorphism as a computable invariant triple,
builds a searchable database over it, and demonstrates that retrieval from this
database provides quantifiable warm-start benefit across domains.

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
================================================================================

The invention comprises four interdependent components:

(1) UNIVERSAL INVARIANT EXTRACTION.  For any oscillatory dynamical system,
compute the invariant triple (omega_0_norm, Q_norm, zeta) by one of:
  (a) Linearization: omega_0 from the linearized system Jacobian eigenvalues,
      Q from the ratio M*omega_0/D at the operating point;
  (b) EDMD: fit a Koopman operator K from trajectory data, extract the dominant
      conjugate eigenvalue pair, and read off omega_0_eff and Q_eff from the
      imaginary and real parts of log(lambda);
  (c) Hybrid: linearization for the operating regime, EDMD for nonlinear
      correction when trajectory energy exceeds a linearization threshold.

(2) REGIME-MEMORY DATABASE.  A searchable database of regime records, each
containing:
  - invariant signature: (log_omega0_norm, log_Q_norm, zeta)
  - stored spectral data: dominant eigenvalues, spectral gap, stability margin,
    modal density estimates, and domain provenance
  - retrieval key: the signature vector, used for nearest-neighbor search

(3) RETRIEVAL AND WARM-START.  For a new system:
  (a) extract its invariant triple;
  (b) query the database for the nearest stored regime by Euclidean distance
      in signature space (or weighted L2 with configurable weights);
  (c) use the retrieved eigenvalues and spectral predictions as initial
      conditions or preconditioner for a numerical solver on the new system;
  (d) update the database with the new system's solved spectral data.

(4) CROSS-DOMAIN TRANSFER.  The retrieval step is domain-agnostic: a regime
stored from solving an RLC circuit can warm-start a solver for a spring-mass
system at the same (omega_0_norm, Q_norm, zeta) coordinates.  Validated
transfer paths: spring-mass to RLC (3.7x improvement), RLC to power grid.

================================================================================
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

1. THE UNIVERSAL INVARIANT TRIPLE

1.1 Motivation

Consider the following governing equations:

  RLC circuit:        L*q_ddot + R*q_dot + (1/C)*q = V(t)
  Spring-mass-damper: m*x_ddot + b*x_dot + k*x     = F(t)
  SMIB power grid:    M*d_ddot + D*d_dot + Pe*sin(d) = Pm  (linearized near d_s)
  Gradient descent:   x_{n+1} = x_n - lr*grad(f)   (continuous limit: ODE)

Each reduces, near equilibrium, to:
    y_ddot + (omega_0/Q)*y_dot + omega_0^2*y = u(t)

with domain-specific parameter mappings:
  omega_0 (natural frequency): sqrt(1/LC), sqrt(k/m), sqrt(Pe*cos(d_s)/M), sqrt(lr*kappa)
  Q (quality factor):          omega_0*L/R, sqrt(km)/b, M*omega_0/D, omega_0/(1-beta)
  zeta (damping ratio):        1/(2Q)

The triple (omega_0, Q, zeta) is invariant to domain relabeling.  Systems with
the same triple exhibit the same linearized spectral structure: identical
eigenvalue positions, identical transient decay rates, identical stability
margins in the normalized frame.

1.2 Normalization

To compare systems across domains with different physical units, normalize:

  log_omega0_norm = log(omega_0 / omega_ref_domain)
  log_Q_norm      = log(Q / Q_ref_domain)
  zeta            = D / (2*M*omega_0)    [dimensionless, no normalization needed]

where omega_ref and Q_ref are domain-specific reference values (e.g., 2*pi*1000
rad/s for circuit domain, 2*pi*60 rad/s for power grid domain).  The
log-normalized coordinates map each domain to a common reference frame where
structural equivalence is proximity in Euclidean distance.

1.3 Geometric Interpretation

In the (log_omega0_norm, log_Q_norm, zeta) space, each operating point of any
oscillatory system is a single point.  Curves of fixed loading ratio in the
power grid domain, fixed LC product in the circuit domain, and fixed lr*kappa
in the optimizer domain are all hyperplanes or curves in this shared space.

The regime-memory database is a collection of labeled points in this space.
Retrieval is nearest-neighbor search.  Cross-domain reuse is possible because
points from different domains at the same coordinates have the same spectral
structure.


2. INVARIANT EXTRACTION METHODS

2.1 Linearization Method

For a system with state x and equilibrium x_s:
  (a) Compute the Jacobian J = dF/dx evaluated at x_s.
  (b) Extract the dominant conjugate eigenvalue pair lambda = sigma +/- i*omega.
  (c) Set omega_0 = |omega|, Q = omega_0 / (2*|sigma|), zeta = |sigma|/omega_0.
  (d) Normalize per Section 1.2.

This method requires only a single Jacobian evaluation.  It applies to any
system with a well-defined equilibrium and analytic or numerically differentiable
dynamics.

2.2 EDMD Koopman Extraction

For nonlinear systems where linearization is insufficient (e.g., Duffing
oscillators far from equilibrium, systems near bifurcation), the Koopman
operator captures the global spectral structure:

  (a) Generate a trajectory x(t) from the system under free evolution.
  (b) Discard the transient (first fraction of the trajectory).
  (c) Construct a dictionary of observables psi(x) (e.g., polynomial basis
      up to degree d, or data-driven basis).
  (d) Solve for K = argmin ||Psi_Y - K*Psi_X||_F (Extended DMD / G-inverse).
  (e) Compute eigendecomposition of K: eigenvalues lambda_j, eigenvectors v_j.
  (f) Identify the dominant oscillatory pair: smallest |Im(log(lambda))|
      among eigenvalues with |lambda| near 1.
  (g) Extract omega_0_eff = |Im(log(lambda_dom))| / dt,
      zeta_eff = -Re(log(lambda_dom)) / (omega_0_eff * dt).

The EDMD method captures energy-dependent frequency shifts in nonlinear systems
(e.g., amplitude-frequency coupling in the Duffing oscillator) that linearization
misses.

2.3 Hybrid Method

When trajectory energy E_0 relative to separatrix energy E_sep satisfies:
  E_0 / E_sep < linearization_threshold (e.g., 0.20):
    use linearization extraction (Section 2.1).
  E_0 / E_sep >= linearization_threshold:
    use EDMD extraction (Section 2.2).

Near the separatrix, the effective frequency omega_0_eff is floored at a
minimum value omega_floor to prevent divergence as the trajectory approaches
the unstable manifold.


3. REGIME-MEMORY DATABASE

3.1 Data Structure

Each regime record comprises:
  - key:             invariant triple (log_omega0_norm, log_Q_norm, zeta) [float32 x 3]
  - eigenvalues:     top-k dominant Koopman eigenvalues [complex64 x k]
  - spectral_gap:    |lambda_1| - |lambda_2| [float32]
  - stability_margin: distance from dominant eigenvalue to unit circle [float32]
  - domain:          source domain label (string)
  - timestamp:       time of insertion

3.2 Insertion

  (a) Extract invariant triple from solved system (Section 2).
  (b) Check for near-duplicate: if any existing record has Euclidean distance
      < merge_threshold (e.g., 0.15) in signature space, skip insertion.
  (c) Otherwise, append new record.

3.3 Retrieval

Given a query triple q = (log_omega0_norm, log_Q_norm, zeta):
  (a) Compute Euclidean distance d_i = ||q - key_i||_2 for all records i.
  (b) Return the top_n records with smallest d_i.
  (c) Optional: filter by stability_margin > threshold for warm-start safety.

3.4 Scalability

The database supports batch indexing with FAISS or similar approximate nearest-
neighbor structures for large libraries.  For libraries up to 10,000 records,
exact L2 search is feasible in under 1 ms on standard hardware.


4. WARM-START AND SOLVER INITIALIZATION

4.1 Eigenvalue Warm-Start

For an iterative eigensolver (e.g., Arnoldi, Lanczos, power iteration):
  (a) Retrieve the nearest regime record.
  (b) Use the stored eigenvalues as initial Ritz values.
  (c) Use the stored eigenvectors (if available) as the initial Krylov subspace.

The warm-started solver converges in fewer iterations because the initial guess
is spectrally close to the true eigenvalues.  Validated speedup: 2,708x versus
cold-start at 750 Hz target frequency, retrieved from {500, 1000, 1500} Hz
memory points.

4.2 Analytic Formula Seeding

For systems with known analytic structure (e.g., the swing equation in Section
1.1), the retrieved regime provides:
  - Initial estimate of natural frequency omega_0
  - Predicted stability margin for pre-screening
  - Expected correction scalar for damping compensation

This enables the analytic formula to be applied directly without time-domain
integration, as demonstrated for the power grid CCT case.

4.3 Preconditioner Construction

For PDE solvers and large-scale linear systems derived from dynamical systems,
the retrieved modal structure informs preconditioner construction:
  - Stored dominant eigenvectors define an approximate invariant subspace.
  - Deflating this subspace accelerates Krylov convergence on the remainder.


5. CROSS-DOMAIN TRANSFER

5.1 Mechanism

Because the invariant triple is domain-agnostic, a regime stored from solving
a spring-mass system can be retrieved when solving an RLC circuit at the same
(log_omega0_norm, log_Q_norm, zeta) coordinates:

  (a) Spring-mass system solved at (omega_0=6283 rad/s, Q=1.0, zeta=0.5).
  (b) Regime record stored with key (0.0, 0.0, 0.5) [at reference point].
  (c) RLC circuit query at same invariant coordinates.
  (d) Spring-mass regime retrieved; its eigenvalues seed the RLC eigensolver.
  (e) RLC solver converges in fewer iterations.

5.2 Validated Transfer Results

  Transfer path                 Metric              Result
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  Spring-mass to RLC (750 Hz)   Convergence gain    3.7x cold-to-warm improvement
  RLC warm-start (750 Hz)       Iterations vs cold  2,708x speedup
  Power grid (IEEE 39-bus)      CCT error / speedup 2.73% / 57,946x
  ----------------------------------------------------------

5.3 Domain Provenance Filtering

Optional: restrict retrieval to records from a specific domain or set of
domains.  This allows domain-specific warm-start (within-domain reuse) or
cross-domain transfer (across-domain reuse) to be selected per use case.


6. NONLINEAR EXTENSION: EDMD-BASED REGIME DETECTION

6.1 Energy-Dependent Frequency

In nonlinear systems (e.g., Duffing oscillator with cubic nonlinearity), the
effective natural frequency depends on trajectory energy:

  omega_0_eff(E) = omega_0_linear * sqrt(1 + 3*beta*A^2 / (4*alpha))

where A is the oscillation amplitude and beta/alpha is the nonlinearity ratio.
EDMD extracts omega_0_eff directly from trajectory data without requiring
knowledge of beta or alpha.

6.2 Curvature Profile

The harmonic path curvature:
  kappa(E) = d(log(omega_0_eff/omega_0_linear)) / d(log_E)

is a domain-invariant shape descriptor that characterizes the nonlinearity
type: positive curvature for hardening (beta > 0), negative for softening
(beta < 0), flat for linear systems.

6.3 Topology Detection via Separatrix

For softening nonlinear systems (beta < 0), the phase space contains a
separatrix at energy E_sep = alpha^2 / (4*|beta|).  The EDMD Koopman spectrum
exhibits a detectable signature as the trajectory approaches the separatrix:
  - omega_0_eff approaches zero (period diverges)
  - Dominant eigenvalue modulus approaches 1 (neutrally stable)
  - Reconstruction error increases

Detecting these signatures in the retrieved regime enables preemptive escalation
to full simulation before instability occurs.  This is the platform generalization
of the power grid CCT escalation policy (Section 7.5 of the companion grid
provisional).

6.4 Regime Storage for Nonlinear Systems

For nonlinear regimes, the database stores:
  - invariant triple at the trajectory energy level
  - omega_0_eff at that energy
  - curvature kappa at that energy
  - near_separatrix flag (E_0/E_sep > 0.85)
  - separatrix_energy (if applicable)

Retrieval matches both the invariant triple AND the energy level (within a
configurable window), ensuring that nonlinear regimes are matched at
comparable operating points.


7. IMPLEMENTATION

7.1 System Architecture

A system implementing the invention comprises:

  (a) INVARIANT EXTRACTOR MODULE: receives system parameters or trajectory
      data; outputs invariant triple (log_omega0_norm, log_Q_norm, zeta).
      Implements linearization (Section 2.1) and EDMD (Section 2.2) paths.

  (b) REGIME DATABASE: persistent store of regime records (Section 3.1).
      Supports insert, query (top-n nearest neighbor), and optional domain
      filtering.

  (c) RETRIEVAL ENGINE: executes nearest-neighbor search given a query triple;
      returns ordered list of candidate regime records.

  (d) WARM-START INTERFACE: injects retrieved spectral data into a downstream
      solver as initial eigenvalues, eigenvector basis, or analytic seeding.

  (e) FEEDBACK LOOP: after the solver converges, inserts the new system's
      spectral result into the database (online learning).

7.2 Computational Procedure

For each new system to be solved:
  (a) Extract invariant triple via Section 2.
  (b) Query regime database for top_n nearest records (Section 3.3).
  (c) If distance < use_threshold: warm-start solver with retrieved data.
      Else: cold-start solver; insert result into database after convergence.
  (d) Return solution; update database.

7.3 Offline Calibration

The regime database can be pre-populated offline from:
  - Systematic parameter sweeps of a reference domain (e.g., RLC circuits
    across L, C, R parameter grids)
  - Published benchmark datasets for a target application domain
  - Cross-domain bootstrap: small reference set in target domain + larger
    set from a structurally equivalent source domain

Once pre-populated, the database provides warm-start benefit immediately for
any new system in or near the covered invariant region.

7.4 Multi-Domain Library

A single regime database may contain records from multiple physical domains.
Domain labels are stored but not required for retrieval.  This enables a
unified library that benefits any query regardless of physical origin.

7.5 Hardware and Deployment

The invention is implementable on:
  - Single-CPU systems for small libraries (< 10,000 records)
  - GPU-accelerated systems for large libraries using batch L2 distance
  - Distributed systems where the database is shared across simulation workers
  - Embedded control systems where the database is pre-loaded at deployment
