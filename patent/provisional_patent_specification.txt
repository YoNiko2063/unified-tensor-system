================================================================================
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
================================================================================

The present invention relates to computational methods for dynamical systems
analysis, and more specifically to systems and methods that (1) construct a
domain-invariant index over dynamical invariants extracted from physical and
computational systems, (2) retrieve prior solutions from memory conditioned on
the topological regime of the query system, (3) detect topological bifurcations
via energy-conditioned separatrix analysis, and (4) classify driven nonlinear
systems as periodic or chaotic using a reconstruction-error-based trust metric
derived from Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD).

================================================================================
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
================================================================================

Engineers and scientists routinely solve parametric optimization and simulation
problems across diverse physical domains: RLC electrical circuits, spring-mass-
damper mechanical systems, gradient-descent optimization algorithms, and
nonlinear oscillators (Duffing, van der Pol, Lorenz). These problems are
physically disparate but dynamically equivalent — they obey the same governing
differential equations up to a coordinate rescaling.

Existing approaches suffer from three fundamental limitations:

(1) Domain specificity. Optimization and simulation tools are implemented
    separately per domain. A solution discovered in one domain (e.g., optimal
    damping ratio for a mechanical resonator) cannot be transferred to an
    equivalent circuit problem without manual re-derivation. This represents
    massive duplicated computational cost.

(2) Regime blindness. Memory and retrieval systems index solutions by parameter
    values (e.g., capacitance, spring constant) rather than dynamical regime.
    Two systems with different parameters but the same qualitative dynamics
    (same natural frequency ω₀ and quality factor Q) are treated as unrelated.
    Conversely, two systems at the same parameter values but different energy
    levels may be in topologically distinct regimes (sub-separatrix vs.
    beyond-separatrix for a softening potential) and are treated as equivalent.

(3) Topology blindness. Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) and Koopman
    operator methods extract spectral invariants from trajectory data but cannot
    distinguish topologically distinct regimes (e.g., a hardening Duffing
    oscillator from a softening one). This leads to incorrect invariant transfer
    between systems that appear similar by spectral metrics but occupy different
    topological basins.

What is needed is a memory and retrieval system that: (a) indexes solutions by
dynamical invariants rather than raw parameters; (b) detects and respects
topological regime boundaries before retrieval; and (c) enables cross-domain
transfer when dynamical equivalence is established, while rejecting transfer
when topological inequivalence is detected.

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
================================================================================

The present invention provides a system and method comprising four novel
technical contributions:

CONTRIBUTION 1: DOMAIN-INVARIANT DYNAMICAL TRIPLE
A three-dimensional representation (log_ω₀_norm, log_Q_norm, ζ) that is
invariant across physical domains. ω₀ is normalized to a domain-specific
reference frequency (enabling comparison between circuits operating at kHz and
optimizers operating in step-frequency units), Q is the dimensionless quality
factor (a true cross-domain invariant), and ζ = 1/(2Q) is the damping ratio.
This triple enables retrieval of solutions from physically disparate domains
that share the same dynamical invariant.

CONTRIBUTION 2: ENERGY-CONDITIONED SEPARATRIX RETRIEVAL
A retrieval gate that conditions memory lookup on energy relative to the
separatrix energy E_sep = α²/(4|β|) of a softening nonlinear oscillator
(α > 0, β < 0). When the query system's total energy E₀ satisfies
E₀/E_sep > threshold (empirically 0.85), the system is flagged as
near-separatrix and retrieval is suppressed or a floor frequency ω_floor is
substituted, because EDMD cannot reliably estimate ω₀_eff in this regime.
The separatrix is defined in energy space, not position space, making the
detection topologically correct under coordinate transformations.

CONTRIBUTION 3: TOPOLOGY-AWARE MANIFOLD DISCRIMINATION
A curvature-profile method that discriminates between topologically distinct
nonlinear oscillator regimes using the Koopman eigenvalue spectrum. For a
Duffing oscillator with effective natural frequency ω₀_eff(E):
  - Hardening potential (β > 0): ω₀_eff increases monotonically with energy
    (curvature profile is flat or positively sloped; no separatrix exists)
  - Softening potential (β < 0): ω₀_eff decreases toward zero as energy
    approaches E_sep (curvature profile exhibits a spike toward zero)
The geometric signature — normalized curvature profile via d(log(ω₀_eff/ω₀))/
d(log E) binned into a fixed-dimension vector — achieves cosine similarity of
0.0 between hardening and softening profiles, establishing a hard topological
boundary in the invariant manifold. The invention detects this boundary and
rejects cross-regime invariant transfer.

CONTRIBUTION 4: BIFURCATION-AWARE EDMD TRUST METRIC
For driven nonlinear systems (e.g., forced Duffing oscillator with external
drive F·cos(Ωt)), the EDMD spectral gap between consecutive eigenvalues
collapses to approximately zero for all limit-cycle attractors, making spectral
gap an unreliable periodicity indicator. The present invention uses EDMD
reconstruction error as the primary trust metric:
    trust = max(0, 1 - recon_error / η_max)
where η_max is a calibrated maximum reconstruction error for purely random
trajectories. Periodic attractors have low reconstruction error (trust ≥ 0.3)
and are classified as Abelian (commutative Koopman algebra). Chaotic attractors
have high reconstruction error (trust < 0.3) and are classified as non-Abelian.
A Poincaré section with orbit-range normalization further classifies the
period multiplicity (period-1, period-2, period-doubling cascade).

CONTRIBUTION 5: ANALYTIC CRITICAL CLEARING TIME WITH UNIVERSAL DAMPING CORRECTION
A closed-form method for estimating Critical Clearing Time (CCT) in power grid
transient stability that replaces iterative RK4 binary search with an analytic
Equal-Area Criterion (EAC) formula extended by a single universal damping
correction scalar. For a Single-Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) swing equation
M·δ̈ + D·δ̇ = Pₘ − Pₑ·sin(δ), the undamped CCT is computed analytically:
    CCT_EAC = √(2M·(δc − δs)/Pₘ)
where δs = arcsin(Pₘ/Pₑ) and cos(δc) = Pₘ(π−2δs)/Pₑ − cos(δs).
For damped systems (D > 0), a first-order correction is applied:
    CCT_corrected = CCT_EAC / (1 − a·ζ)
where ζ = D/(2Mω₀) is the damping ratio and a is a scalar fitted by ordinary
least squares across all generators and damping levels. The scalar a is
universal for uniform-loading grids because the product ω₀·CCT_EAC is invariant
across all generators at fixed loading ratio — a geometric consequence of the
equal-area constraint, not a fitting artifact. Empirical results on the IEEE
39-bus New England system (10 generators) demonstrate 57,946× speedup over RK4
binary search with maximum CCT error of 2.73% across ζ ∈ [0, 0.20]. Leave-2-out
cross-validation across all C(10,2) = 45 generator subsets confirms a = 1.51 ±
0.01 (range 2.3%, coefficient of variation 0.66%), establishing universality.

COMBINED SYSTEM: These five contributions are combined in a memory-augmented
optimization and simulation system that: retrieves candidate solutions from
cross-domain memory using the domain-invariant triple; gates retrieval by
energy-conditioned separatrix analysis; rejects topologically incompatible
transfers using the curvature discriminator; classifies driven-system dynamics
using the trust metric; and estimates power grid critical clearing times
analytically with universal damping correction. Empirical results demonstrate
2708× warm-start speedup vs. cold-start optimization, 3.7× cross-domain
improvement when transferring solutions from spring-mass mechanical systems to
RLC electrical circuits, and 57,946× CCT estimation speedup with 2.73% maximum
error on the IEEE 39-bus benchmark.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
================================================================================

The following description sets forth specific embodiments of the invention.
Alternative embodiments and variations will be apparent to those skilled in
the art of dynamical systems, signal processing, and computational optimization.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 1: DOMAIN-INVARIANT DYNAMICAL TRIPLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1.1 Overview

Physical systems governed by second-order linear ordinary differential equations
of the form:

    m·ẍ + b·ẋ + k·x = 0   (mechanical)
    L·q̈ + R·q̇ + (1/C)·q = 0   (electrical)

share the same normalized form when parameterized by natural frequency
ω₀ = √(k/m) = 1/√(LC) and quality factor Q = ω₀·m/b = ω₀·L/R.

Gradient descent with momentum on a quadratic objective f(x) = κx²/2 obeys:

    x_{t+1} = x_t - lr·∇f(x_t) + β·(x_t - x_{t-1})

which is equivalent to a damped oscillator with ω₀ = √(lr·κ) [rad/step] and
Q = ω₀ / (1 - β) (where β is the momentum coefficient, β ∈ [0, 1)).

1.2 The Domain-Invariant Triple

The invention defines a three-dimensional domain-invariant representation:

    v = (log_ω₀_norm, log_Q_norm, ζ)

where:
    log_ω₀_norm = log(ω₀ / ω₀_ref(domain))
    log_Q_norm  = log(Q / 1)   [Q dimensionless, reference Q=1]
    ζ           = 1 / (2Q)    [damping ratio]

and ω₀_ref(domain) is a domain-specific reference frequency:
    - Physical systems (RLC, spring-mass): ω₀_ref = 2π × 1000 rad/s (1 kHz)
    - Gradient descent: ω₀_ref = 1 rad/step

1.3 Retrieval Using the Domain-Invariant Triple

A memory system stores evaluated (parameter, objective_value) pairs indexed by
their domain-invariant triple. Given a query system in any domain:

    (a) Compute (ω₀_query, Q_query) from domain-specific parameters.
    (b) Compute v_query = (log(ω₀_query/ω₀_ref), log(Q_query), 1/(2Q_query)).
    (c) Retrieve k nearest neighbors in triple-space by Euclidean distance.
    (d) Infer domain-native parameters from retrieved (ω₀_retrieved, Q_retrieved)
        using the inverse mapping for the target domain.
    (e) Initialize optimization from retrieved parameter values.

This enables warm-starting an RLC circuit optimization from a previously solved
spring-mass problem at the same (ω₀, Q) operating point.

1.4 Empirical Results

The method achieves:
    - 2708× reduction in objective function evaluations for a 750 Hz target
      frequency retrieval when a nearby prior solution exists in memory.
    - 3.7× improvement in cross-domain transfer: solutions from spring-mass
      memory warm-start RLC optimization with convergence improvement factor
      of 3.7× relative to cold-start RLC optimization.

SECTION 2: ENERGY-CONDITIONED SEPARATRIX RETRIEVAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2.1 Nonlinear Oscillator Background

A Duffing oscillator with softening potential obeys:

    ẍ + δẋ + αx + βx³ = 0   (unforced, α > 0, β < 0)

The potential energy V(x) = αx²/2 + βx⁴/4 has a local minimum at x=0 and
saddle points at x = ±√(α/|β|) when β < 0. The separatrix energy is:

    E_sep = α² / (4|β|)

For total mechanical energy E₀ = ẋ²/2 + V(x):
    - E₀ < E_sep: bounded oscillation in the potential well
    - E₀ > E_sep: unbounded trajectory (escape from well)

2.2 Energy-Based Regime Detection

The invention computes E₀ from initial conditions and compares to E_sep:

    near_separatrix = (E₀ / E_sep > η_near)   [η_near = 0.85 empirically]

The detection is performed in energy space, not position space, because:
    (a) Topology is an energy-level concept (connected sublevel sets).
    (b) Position-based detection fails under coordinate transformations.
    (c) Energy is invariant under Hamiltonian coordinate changes.

2.3 Retrieval Conditioning

When near_separatrix = True:
    (a) EDMD cannot reliably fit a Koopman operator because the trajectory
        spends time near the saddle point where period → ∞.
    (b) The effective natural frequency ω₀_eff computed from EDMD eigenvalues
        approaches zero, but this limit is not observable with finite trajectory
        length.
    (c) The invention substitutes a floor frequency ω_floor and sets
        near_separatrix=True in the memory entry.
    (d) Retrieval queries whose E₀/E_sep > η_near are only matched against
        entries also flagged near_separatrix=True, preventing incorrect
        transfer of sub-separatrix solutions to near-separatrix queries.

2.4 Implementation

The retrieval gate is implemented as:

    def retrieve(query, memory):
        v_query = compute_triple(query)
        E_ratio = query.E0 / separatrix_energy(query)
        if E_ratio > ETA_NEAR:
            candidates = [m for m in memory if m.near_separatrix]
        else:
            candidates = [m for m in memory if not m.near_separatrix]
        return nearest_neighbor(v_query, candidates)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 3: TOPOLOGY-AWARE MANIFOLD DISCRIMINATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3.1 The Curvature Profile

For a nonlinear oscillator, the effective natural frequency ω₀_eff varies with
amplitude A (or equivalently, with energy E₀). The invention characterizes this
variation via the curvature profile:

    κ(log_E) = d(log(ω₀_eff / ω₀_linear)) / d(log_E)

where ω₀_linear = √α is the small-oscillation linear frequency.

For a hardening Duffing oscillator (β > 0):
    - ω₀_eff increases with A: positive curvature, bounded
    - No separatrix exists; trajectory is always bounded
    - Curvature profile is approximately flat on log-log scale

For a softening Duffing oscillator (β < 0) below separatrix:
    - ω₀_eff decreases toward zero as E₀ → E_sep
    - Curvature profile exhibits a downward spike near E_sep
    - The spike is a topological signature of separatrix existence

3.2 Geometric Signature

The curvature profile κ(log_E) is binned into n_bins equal intervals over the
energy range of the trajectory and normalized to unit norm. This produces a
fixed-length geometric signature vector s ∈ R^n_bins.

Two systems are compared using cosine similarity:
    sim(s₁, s₂) = s₁ · s₂ / (‖s₁‖ · ‖s₂‖)

Key result: For hardening (flat profile) vs. softening (spiked profile),
cosine similarity ≈ 0.0. This constitutes topological discrimination — the
manifold separates qualitatively distinct dynamical regimes.

Degenerate case: If both profiles are flat (both β = 0 or both far from
separatrix), similarity = 1.0 (profiles are identical up to normalization).

3.3 Bifurcation Approach Detection

The invention further implements a three-criterion bifurcation approach detector:

    (a) Curvature spike: max(|κ|) in recent energy window exceeds threshold
    (b) Frequency floor: ω₀_eff(E) < ω_floor for multiple consecutive points
    (c) Unit-circle proximity: the dominant oscillatory EDMD eigenvalue
        satisfies |λ_dominant| → 1.0 (period doubling precursor)

Criterion (c) uses only the oscillatory eigenvalue with smallest |Im(log λ)|,
not the full EDMD polynomial eigenvalue set, to avoid false positives from
non-physical eigenvalue branches introduced by polynomial basis expansion.

3.4 Cross-Domain Restriction

A cross-domain transfer is permitted only when:
    - The source and target systems share the same topological regime
      (both sub-separatrix, or both hardening, determined by sign(β) and E₀/E_sep)
    - The curvature profile similarity exceeds a threshold (empirically 0.7)
    - The energy log-ratio |log_E_query - log_E_stored| is within a window

When these conditions are not met, the retrieval system returns no result and
the optimization proceeds cold-start.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 4: BIFURCATION-AWARE EDMD TRUST METRIC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

4.1 Failure Mode of Spectral Gap for Driven Systems

For driven nonlinear systems (forced oscillator: ẍ + δẋ + αx + βx³ = F·cos(Ωt)),
the system settles to a limit cycle attractor in steady state. The EDMD
spectral gap — defined as the magnitude difference between the two dominant
eigenvalues — collapses to approximately zero because all limit-cycle eigenvalues
lie on or near the unit circle. This makes spectral gap an unreliable classifier
for distinguishing periodic from chaotic attractors in driven systems.

4.2 Reconstruction-Error Trust Metric

The invention defines trust as a function of EDMD reconstruction error:

    trust = max(0, 1 - recon_error / η_max)

where:
    - recon_error = ‖Φ(X') - K·Φ(X)‖_F / ‖Φ(X')‖_F
      (Frobenius-norm relative error of Koopman propagation)
    - η_max is calibrated on purely random (white noise) trajectories as the
      maximum expected reconstruction error when no Koopman structure exists
    - trust ∈ [0, 1], where trust = 1 means perfect Koopman structure

Classification:
    is_periodic (Abelian) : trust ≥ 0.3
    is_chaotic             : trust < 0.3

Physical basis: A periodic attractor has a finite-dimensional Koopman invariant
subspace that the EDMD polynomial basis can span, resulting in low reconstruction
error. A chaotic attractor has an infinite-dimensional or fractal Koopman
spectrum that the polynomial basis cannot capture, resulting in high error.

4.3 Period Classification via Poincaré Section

Given classification as periodic, the period multiplicity is determined by a
Poincaré section with orbit-range normalization:

    (a) Sample state x at t = n · T_drive for n = n_transient, ..., n_total
        (stroboscopic sampling synchronized to the drive period T_drive)
    (b) Compute orbit_range = max(x_Poincaré) - min(x_Poincaré)
    (c) Compute normalized span: span_norm = span / orbit_range
    (d) Count clusters: period-k identified by k distinct clusters with
        inter-cluster gaps > 12% of section span

Orbit-range normalization is required because phase drift (when T_drive/dt
is not an integer) introduces a 1-3% smearing of Poincaré points that would
otherwise be misclassified as multi-period oscillations.

The invention thereby classifies driven Duffing dynamics as:
period-1, period-2, period-4 (period-doubling cascade), or chaotic,
using only trajectory data and without access to the governing equations.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 5: ANALYTIC CRITICAL CLEARING TIME WITH UNIVERSAL DAMPING CORRECTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

5.1 Problem Statement

Transient stability assessment of a power grid requires determining the Critical
Clearing Time (CCT) — the maximum fault duration for which a generator maintains
synchronism after a fault. N-1 contingency screening requires O(G × F) CCT
computations, where G is the number of generators and F is the number of
credible faults. The standard reference method — binary search over fault
duration with 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) integration — requires approximately:

    ~13 binary-search iterations × 3,000 settle-steps × 4 RK4 evaluations
    ≈ 156,000 ODE evaluations per CCT

This is computationally prohibitive for real-time or near-real-time screening.

5.2 System Model

The Single-Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) classical swing equation is:

    M · δ̈ + D · δ̇ = Pₘ − Pₑ · sin(δ)

where δ is rotor angle [rad], ω = δ̇ is speed deviation [rad/s], M = 2H/ωs is
inertia [pu·s²/rad] (H is inertia constant [s], ωs = 2π·60 rad/s), D is damping
[pu·s/rad], Pₘ is mechanical power [pu], and Pₑ is peak electrical power [pu].

The stable equilibrium is δs = arcsin(Pₘ/Pₑ). The unstable equilibrium is
δu = π − δs. The separatrix energy (energy barrier to loss of synchronism) is:

    E_sep = 2Pₑ·cos(δs) − Pₘ·(π − 2δs)

This is structurally identical to the separatrix energy α²/(4|β|) of the
softening Duffing oscillator — both define the energy boundary of the stability
region in the invariant manifold shared across dynamical domains.

5.3 Equal-Area Criterion (Undamped, Three-Phase Fault)

For a complete three-phase fault (Pₑ → 0 during fault) and zero damping (D=0),
the equal-area criterion gives the critical clearing angle analytically:

    cos(δc) = Pₘ·(π − 2δs) / Pₑ  −  cos(δs)                 (EAC-1)

The critical clearing time follows from exact integration of M·δ̈ = Pₘ:

    CCT_EAC = √( 2M·(δc − δs) / Pₘ )                          (EAC-2)

This formula requires zero ODE evaluations. It is analytically exact for D = 0
and a complete three-phase fault.

5.4 Universal Invariant: ω₀ · CCT_EAC

The linearized natural frequency at stable equilibrium is:

    ω₀ = √(Pₑ · cos(δs) / M)

For all generators operating at the same loading ratio Pₑ/Pₘ = 2 (δs = 30°),
the product:

    ω₀ · CCT_EAC = √(2 · √3 · (δc − δs)) ≈ 1.73              (INV-1)

is a universal constant, independent of M, Pₘ, Pₑ individually. This invariant
is a consequence of the geometry of the equal-area constraint — the same
geometric structure that defines the invariant manifold of Contribution 1.
Equation (INV-1) guarantees that a single scalar correction to CCT_EAC applies
universally across all generators at the same loading ratio.

5.5 Damping Correction

For D > 0, damping reduces rotor kinetic energy during the fault phase, causing
the true CCT (reference) to exceed CCT_EAC. The first-order correction is:

    CCT_corrected = CCT_EAC / (1 − a·ζ)                        (CORR-1)

where ζ = D/(2Mω₀) is the damping ratio and a is fitted by ordinary least
squares (OLS). Defining eᵢ = CCT_EAC,i − CCT_ref,i < 0 and xᵢ = ζᵢ·CCT_ref,i:

    a = −Σ(eᵢ·xᵢ) / Σ(xᵢ²)                                    (OLS-1)

The universality of a follows from (INV-1): since ω₀·CCT_EAC is constant, the
first-order perturbation slope C = ω₀·CCT_EAC/3 ≈ 0.577 is also constant. The
fitted a absorbs higher-order terms and is therefore generator-independent.

5.6 Cross-Validation of Universality

To verify that a is a structural property and not a fitting artifact, leave-2-out
cross-validation is performed across all C(G,2) generator subsets. For each
split, a is fitted on (G−2) generators and tested on the 2 held-out generators.

On the IEEE 39-bus New England system (G=10, Anderson & Fouad 2003):
    - a (mean): 1.5109
    - a (std):  0.0100  (CV = 0.66%)
    - a (range/mean): 2.3%  (stability gate: < 10%)
    - Max test error on held-out generators: 2.90%

The near-zero coefficient of variation (0.66%) confirms that a is determined
by the geometry of the equal-area constraint (Equation INV-1), not by which
machines appear in the training set.

5.7 Invariant Embedding Distance

The embedding distance of a generator in the domain-invariant triple space
(log_ω₀_norm, log_Q_norm, ζ) varies by less than 10⁻⁸ across all 10 generators
at the same ζ — confirming that the triple is generator-independent and that
the damping correction operates on a geometrically universal quantity.

5.8 Empirical Results — IEEE 39-Bus Benchmark

Reference data: Anderson & Fouad (2003), Table 2.7, 10-generator New England
equivalent of the IEEE 39-bus system. All generators at Pₑ = 2Pₘ (δs = 30°).
Damping sweep: ζ ∈ {0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20}.

    Undamped (D=0): mean CCT error = 0.8%, mean speedup = 57,946×
    Corrected (D>0): max CCT error = 2.73% across all 50 (generator, ζ) pairs
    Validated range: ζ ∈ [0, 0.20], Q ∈ [2, ∞) — full inter-area and local mode range

The corrected formula:
    CCT_corrected = √(2M·(δc−δs)/Pₘ) / (1 − 1.51·ζ)

requires zero ODE evaluations per machine per contingency.

    Method: Compute E_sep from query parameters; classify query energy regime;
            filter memory to matching regime before nearest-neighbor retrieval

Component D: Topology Discriminator
    Input: stored curvature profile, query curvature profile
    Output: compatibility score ∈ [0, 1]
    Method: Cosine similarity of geometric signatures; reject if score < 0.7

Component E: Trust Classifier
    Input: EDMD reconstruction error
    Output: {is_periodic, is_chaotic, period_multiplicity}
    Method: Reconstruction-error trust metric + Poincaré section analysis

Component F: Memory Store
    Structure: List of entries {v, params, E_regime, curvature_signature,
               trust, near_separatrix, objective_value}
    Indexed by: domain-invariant triple v for approximate nearest-neighbor search
    Operations: insert, retrieve_candidates(v_query, regime_filter)

5.2 Optimization Workflow

Given a new optimization target in domain D with target (ω₀_target, Q_target):

    Step 1: Compute v_query from (ω₀_target, Q_target, domain=D)
    Step 2: Run energy estimation on representative initial condition
    Step 3: Apply retrieval gate (Components C, D) to get candidates
    Step 4: If candidates exist:
               Infer domain-D native parameters from best candidate
               Initialize optimizer at inferred parameters
            Else:
               Initialize optimizer at domain-D default (cold start)
    Step 5: Run local optimization; evaluate objective
    Step 6: Fit EDMD on resulting trajectory (Component B)
    Step 7: Classify dynamics (Component E)
    Step 8: Store result in Memory (Component F) with domain-invariant triple

5.3 Multi-Objective Extension

The domain-invariant triple naturally extends to multi-objective optimization
over (ω₀, Q) simultaneously:

    Objective: J = w_freq · |ω₀_achieved - ω₀_target| / ω₀_target
                 + w_Q   · |Q_achieved  - Q_target|  / Q_target

Memory entries store the 2D operating point (ω₀, Q) and retrieval is by
Euclidean distance in the 2D (log_ω₀_norm, log_Q_norm) subspace.

Spearman rank correlation of retrieved-solution quality vs. memory distance
achieves ρ ≥ 0.9 for both RLC and spring-mass domains across Q ∈ {0.5, 1, 2, 5}.

SECTION 7: ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

7.1 Alternative Basis Functions for EDMD
The polynomial observable basis can be replaced with radial basis functions,
Fourier modes, or neural network embeddings (Deep EDMD) without departing from
the scope of the invention. The trust metric and reconstruction-error formulation
apply to any EDMD variant.

7.2 Alternative Distance Metrics
The domain-invariant triple can be indexed using any metric supporting
approximate nearest-neighbor search: cosine distance, Mahalanobis distance
with learned covariance, or graph-based indices (HNSW, FAISS). The energy-
conditioning gate applies regardless of the chosen metric.

7.3 Non-Duffing Nonlinear Oscillators
The energy-conditioned separatrix detection applies to any potential V(x) with
a local maximum. The separatrix energy E_sep generalizes to the saddle-point
potential energy. For van der Pol oscillators, limit-cycle energy replaces E_sep
as the conditioning quantity.

7.4 Discrete-Time Systems
The domain-invariant triple applies to discrete-time dynamical systems by
interpreting ω₀ as frequency in [rad/step] rather than [rad/s]. The trust
metric applies without modification to EDMD fitted to discrete-time trajectories.

7.5 Higher-Dimensional Systems
The curvature profile generalizes to multi-dimensional systems by tracking
the dominant Koopman eigenvalue frequency as a function of energy in the
dominant mode direction. The geometric signature remains a 1D profile
parameterized by energy level.

7.6 Neural Network Koopman Approximation
The EDMD Koopman matrix K can be approximated by a neural network trained
to minimize reconstruction error. The trust metric — reconstruction error
relative to random-noise baseline — applies directly to the neural
approximation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 8: DOMAIN APPLICABILITY — THE UNIVERSAL GEOMETRIC PATTERN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

8.1 The Unifying Mathematical Structure

All domains covered by this invention share the same normalized governing
equation. Any physical, computational, or biological system that can be
characterized — exactly or approximately — by a second-order ordinary
differential equation:

    M·ẍ + D·ẋ + K·x = F(t)                                     (GEN-1)

or its discrete-time equivalent, is characterizable by the domain-invariant
triple (ω₀, Q, ζ) where ω₀ = √(K/M), Q = Mω₀/D, ζ = 1/(2Q).

The invention's methods — domain-invariant indexing, energy-conditioned
retrieval, topology discrimination, EDMD trust classification, and universal
correction scalar fitting — apply to any system of this form, regardless of
the physical interpretation of the variables x, M, D, K.

The core IP claim: the geometric structure of the invariant manifold
(log_ω₀_norm, log_Q_norm, ζ) is universal. Any domain-specific quantity
whose characteristic time T_char satisfies the universality condition:

    ω₀ · T_char = f(loading_ratio_only)                         (UNI-1)

admits a loading-class-specific scalar correction a such that:

    T_corrected = T_analytic / (1 − a·ζ)                        (UNI-2)

where a is invariant across all instances within the same loading class.
This is the geometric fingerprint of the equal-area / separatrix structure
in the invariant manifold.

    Domain 6 — Superconducting Quantum Circuits (Transmon Qubits)
    Governing equation: the Josephson junction circuit is governed by:
        C·φ̈ + (1/R)·φ̇ + Ic·sin(φ) = I_ext

    the force factor; i is coil current.
    ω₀ = 1/√(Mₘₛ·Cₘₛ) (resonance frequency), Q = Mₘₛ·ω₀/Rₘₛ.

8.4 The Universal Correction Principle (Domain-Agnostic Claim)

For any system in any domain satisfying GEN-1 with a characteristic time
T_char(params, loading) that obeys universality condition (UNI-1):

    STEP 1: Compute T_analytic using the undamped (D=0) analytic formula
            applicable to that domain.
    STEP 2: Compute ζ = D/(2Mω₀) from domain parameters.
    STEP 3: Apply correction: T_corrected = T_analytic / (1 − a·ζ)
    STEP 4: Fit a once per loading class by OLS across representative
            instances; verify universality by cross-validation.

This procedure is claimed for all domains listed in Sections 8.2, 8.3, and 9,
and for any future domain where universality condition (UNI-1) holds.

8.5 Nonlinear Extension of the Domain-Invariant Triple

For nonlinear systems where K and D are state-dependent, the domain-invariant
triple is generalized as follows:

(a) EDMD-extracted triple: ω₀_eff and Q_eff are computed from the dominant
    Koopman eigenvalue pair extracted from trajectory data, as specified in
    Claim 20. This is valid for any nonlinear system admitting a finite-
    dimensional Koopman invariant subspace (periodic and quasi-periodic attractors).

(b) Energy-parameterized triple: For systems with a known potential V(x),
    ω₀_eff(E) = sqrt(V''(x_eq(E)) / M_eff(E)) varies with energy E. The
    triple is evaluated at the operating energy level and the energy-conditioned
    gate (Contribution 2) partitions the nonlinear state space into distinct
    retrieval regimes separated by the separatrix.

(c) Linearized triple at equilibrium: ω₀ = sqrt(K(x_eq)/M), Q = M·ω₀/D(x_eq,0)
    evaluated at the stable equilibrium x_eq provides a first-order index valid
    for small-to-moderate deviations. The curvature profile (Contribution 3)
    quantifies the energy range over which this linearization remains accurate.

The invention thereby covers the full spectrum from weakly nonlinear systems
(where the linearized triple suffices) to strongly nonlinear systems near
bifurcation or separatrix crossing (where the energy-conditioned gate and
topology discriminator are essential). All three nonlinear extension modes are
implemented and claimed in Claims 1–29.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 9: EXTENDED DOMAIN APPLICABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The inventive methods of Contributions 1–5 apply to any domain in which a
dynamical regime can be characterized by a frequency-like scale ω₀, a
dissipation-like ratio Q (or ζ = 1/(2Q)), and a topological energy boundary
(separatrix or stability limit). This section enumerates additional domains
organized by field. For each domain, the role of ω₀, Q, T_char, and the
applicable inventive contribution are identified.

────────────────────────────────
9.A COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND PHYSICS-INFORMED AI
────────────────────────────────

9.A.1 Nonlinear PDE Solving and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
PINNs embed a PDE residual into a neural network loss and minimize over a
collocation grid. The loss landscape near a trained solution is governed by
the PDE's spectral structure: the dominant eigenvalue of the linearized
residual operator defines an effective ω₀, and the ratio of dominant to
subdominant eigenvalues defines an effective Q. The invention's domain-invariant
triple indexes PINN training regimes; the energy-conditioned gate identifies when
residual energy exceeds a stability threshold (separatrix analog in loss space);
and the EDMD trust metric classifies whether training has converged to a periodic
attractor (limit cycle in gradient flow) or is chaotic (stochastic gradient noise
dominated). The universal correction (UNI-2) applies to convergence time
estimates: T_convergence = T_analytic_linear / (1 − a·ζ_eff) where ζ_eff is the
effective damping ratio of the gradient flow around the solution manifold.

9.A.2 Neural Operators for Parametric PDE Families
Neural operators (DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator) learn mappings from PDE
parameters to solution fields. For a parametric family sharing the same operator
topology (same differential order, same boundary condition type, same coupling
structure), solutions share a dominant frequency ω₀(parameters) and quality
factor Q(parameters). The invention indexes neural operator regimes by the
domain-invariant triple of the PDE's linearized spectral profile; retrieves
stored operator weights from a nearby regime as warm initialization; and applies
the topology discriminator (Contribution 3) to reject initialization from
topologically distinct operator classes (e.g., elliptic vs. parabolic PDE).

9.A.3 Surrogate Modeling for CFD and Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
Computational fluid dynamics and structural FEA models have dominant resonant
modes (ω₀ = structural natural frequency; Q = modal quality factor). The
invention stores prior simulation results indexed by the modal triple and
retrieves warm-start basis vectors (POD modes, reduced basis) for a new
simulation in the same dynamical regime. The energy-conditioned gate identifies
when the query operating point is near a flutter or buckling bifurcation
(separatrix analog in parameter space), preventing incorrect basis transfer.
T_char = simulation wall-clock time to convergence; the universal correction
applies when ω₀·T_converge is mesh-resolution-determined.

9.A.4 Turbulence Closure Modeling
Turbulent flows exhibit a cascade of eddy structures with characteristic
frequencies ω₀(k) at wavenumber k and effective quality factors Q(k) = ω₀(k)/
γ(k) where γ(k) is the eddy decay rate. The Koopman EDMD decomposition
(Contribution 4) extracts dominant turbulent modes; the trust metric classifies
whether the flow is in an organized (low-dimensional Koopman) or chaotic regime.
The universal correction applies to large-eddy simulation subgrid closure: the
subgrid stress tensor correction scales as 1/(1 − a·ζ_subgrid) where ζ_subgrid
is the damping ratio of the subgrid model.

9.A.5 Inverse Parameter Identification
Inverse problems (parameter estimation from observations) reduce to minimization
of a residual over parameter space. The gradient flow of the residual near the
true parameter is a damped oscillator with ω₀ = √(λ_min(∇²J)) and Q inversely
proportional to the condition number. The invention retrieves warm-start parameter
estimates from memory entries at nearby (ω₀, Q) operating points, accelerating
convergence. The topology discriminator rejects retrieval when the query
parameter space has a different separatrix structure (multimodal posteriors).

9.A.6 Chaotic System Prediction
Directly covered by Contribution 4 (EDMD trust metric) and Contribution 3
(curvature profile bifurcation approach). Extended application: for any
observable time series from an unknown system, the invention classifies the
generating system as periodic, quasi-periodic, or chaotic using Koopman
reconstruction error, without access to the governing equations. Short-term
prediction is achievable in the Abelian (low-chaos) regime; long-term prediction
fails gracefully in the chaotic regime (trust < threshold) with explicit
uncertainty quantification.

9.A.7 Multi-Scale Physical Simulation Acceleration
Multi-scale systems (molecular dynamics + continuum, micro + macro-structural)
operate at multiple ω₀ scales. The invention stores Koopman representations at
each scale indexed by the domain-invariant triple and retrieves compatible
fine-scale solutions given a coarse-scale regime query. The energy-conditioned
gate identifies when scales are coupled (near-separatrix in scale coupling
energy), preventing inappropriate single-scale retrieval. T_char is the fine-
scale integration time per coarse timestep; universal correction applies when
ω₀_fine·T_fine is ratio-of-scales determined.

9.A.8 Quantum System Approximation
Extended from Claim 11. Beyond Josephson junctions, applies to:
(a) Quantum harmonic oscillator arrays (ion traps, optical lattices): ω₀ from
    trap frequency, Q from motional coherence time, T_char = thermalization time.
(b) Quantum annealing: the transverse field Ising model near the phase transition
    is a softening Duffing analog (β < 0, separatrix = gap closing point). The
    annealing time T_anneal ~ 1/gap² is the CCT analog; universal correction
    applies when the gap closing rate is loading-class-determined.
(c) Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE): gradient flow on the variational
    manifold has ω₀ from the Hessian spectrum and Q from measurement noise;
    the invention warm-starts VQE from memory of nearby Hamiltonians.

9.A.9 Materials Discovery and Lattice Property Prediction
Crystal lattice vibrations (phonons) are characterized by a phonon dispersion
relation ω(k) and phonon lifetimes τ(k) = Q(k)/ω(k). The domain-invariant triple
at each wavevector k indexes phonon regimes. The invention retrieves Koopman
representations of lattice dynamics from memory of structurally similar materials
(same space group symmetry, similar force constants → similar ω₀/Q topology),
enabling rapid phonon band structure prediction without full DFT calculation.
The energy-conditioned gate identifies phonon instabilities (imaginary frequency
modes = β < 0 Duffing, separatrix = phase transition energy).

9.A.10 Semiconductor Device Modeling
Carrier transport in semiconductor devices is governed by drift-diffusion
equations that in the small-signal regime reduce to GEN-1:
    Cg·V̈ + (1/Rds)·V̇ + (1/Ls)·V = I_gate
where Cg is gate capacitance, Rds drain-source resistance, Ls parasitic
inductance. ω₀ = 1/√(Cg·Ls), Q = Rds/√(Ls/Cg). The invention retrieves
device operating point warm-starts from memory indexed by (ω₀, Q); topology
discriminator identifies punch-through or avalanche breakdown bifurcations
(separatrix in carrier density space).

9.A.11 Electromagnetic Field Approximation
Maxwell's wave equation in a resonant cavity:
    ε₀·Ë + σ·Ė + (1/μ₀)·∇²E = J_source
reduces to GEN-1 with ω₀ = c/√(με)·(mπ/L) for mode (m) in a cavity of length L,
and Q = ω₀·ε₀/σ. The invention retrieves cavity mode Koopman representations
from memory indexed by (ω₀, Q) for rapid field approximation across geometries.

9.A.12 Circuit Nonlinear Component Modeling
Nonlinear circuit elements (varactor diodes, Josephson junctions, memristors)
introduce β ≠ 0 terms into GEN-1, creating Duffing-type dynamics. The topology
discriminator (Contribution 3) classifies hardening (β > 0, e.g., saturable
inductor) vs. softening (β < 0, e.g., tunnel diode) nonlinearities. The energy-
conditioned gate identifies when the operating point approaches the nonlinear
region (E₀/E_sep > 0.85), preventing incorrect linear-regime retrieval.

────────────────────────────────
9.B ENERGY, POWER, AND INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS
────────────────────────────────

9.B.1 Smart Grid Optimization
Extension of Contribution 5. Multi-machine power systems with center-of-inertia
corrections: each generator's SMIB representation is indexed by its domain-
invariant triple; the invention identifies inter-area oscillation modes by
clustering generators with similar (ω₀, Q) in triple-space. Universal correction
parameter a is fitted per inter-area mode class (loading ratio class). T_char =
inter-area oscillation damping time (time for a contingency disturbance to damp
to ±5% of steady state).

9.B.2 Renewable Energy Output Forecasting
Wind turbine mechanical output obeys GEN-1 as a torsional oscillator:
    J·Ω̈ + b·Ω̇ + k·Ω = τ_wind
where J is rotor inertia, b is damping, k is drivetrain stiffness, τ_wind is
wind torque. ω₀ = √(k/J), Q = Jω₀/b. Solar irradiance has dominant harmonic
at ω₀ = 2π/24h (diurnal) with seasonal amplitude modulation. The invention
indexes forecast regimes by (ω₀, Q, ζ) and retrieves stored production profiles;
topology discriminator identifies intermittency regime shifts (β-change events).

9.B.3 Battery Degradation Modeling
The Randles circuit model of a battery cell is:
    L·İ + (R_s + R_ct)·I + V_c = V_OCV − V_terminal
where R_ct, C_dl (charge-transfer resistance, double-layer capacitance) form an
RC circuit with ω₀ = 1/√(L·C_dl), Q = ω₀·C_dl·R_ct. Degradation shifts (ω₀, Q)
over charge cycles; the invention tracks this shift in triple-space as a
degradation trajectory. The energy-conditioned gate identifies when the cell
approaches lithium plating or thermal runaway (separatrix in electrochemical
energy space). T_char = time to reach end-of-life capacity threshold.

9.B.4 Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Systems
Rotating machinery (bearings, gears, motors) exhibits resonances at ω₀
(bearing race frequency, gear mesh frequency) with Q determined by lubrication
and structural damping. Incipient faults shift ω₀ and reduce Q. The invention
indexes healthy-state Koopman representations in triple-space; fault detection
is triggered when the live (ω₀, Q) deviates beyond a retrieval threshold from
the nearest healthy memory entry. The topology discriminator identifies
qualitative fault type changes (crack initiation = new β < 0 term in GEN-1).

9.B.5 Digital Twin Industrial Modeling
A digital twin mirrors a physical asset's dynamical state. The invention provides
the indexing infrastructure: each physical operating regime is a memory entry
(ω₀, Q, trust, curvature_profile); the twin retrieves the matching entry and
uses stored Koopman eigenfunctions as a reduced-order model. Regime transitions
(startup, shutdown, fault) are flagged by the topology discriminator and trust
metric. Universal correction: T_char = time to synchronize twin state to physical
state after a disturbance.

9.B.6 Oil and Gas Reservoir Modeling
Pressure transient analysis in porous media (diffusivity equation) admits a
second-order telegraph approximation at high frequencies:
    (ρ·c/κ)·p̈ + (1/κ)·ṗ − ∇²p = q_source
with ω₀ = √(κ·c)/L (reservoir diffusion frequency), Q inversely proportional
to viscous dissipation. The invention indexes pressure transient regimes by
(ω₀, Q); retrieves stored decline curve models from nearby reservoir types;
applies universal correction to well productivity index (CCT analog = time to
pseudosteady state).

9.C.1 Structural Health Monitoring
Extension of Claim 13. Structural modes (beams, plates, shells, bridges) shift

increase). The invention provides a baseline Koopman memory indexed by healthy
modal triples; continuous monitoring detects deviation from baseline in triple-

    Ṙ = γ·I
linearized around endemic equilibrium gives oscillations with:
    ω₀ = √(βγ·S* − γ²), Q = ω₀/(2γ)
Epidemic waves are periodic for ω₀ > 0 (above herd immunity threshold). The

experimental designs that would drive the system beyond the separatrix
(destructive operating conditions).

9.G.6 Federated Learning Across Institutions
In federated learning, distributed clients share model updates without sharing
raw data. The invention provides a regime-aware aggregation mechanism: clients

identified and their updates are aggregated using the domain-invariant triple
as a compatibility gate, preventing topologically incompatible gradient mixing.

9.G.7 Autonomous Defense, Surveillance, and Security Systems

ABSTRACT
================================================================================

A system and method for topology-aware invariant indexing, cross-domain
dynamical memory, and analytic power grid stability estimation exploits
dynamical equivalence across physical domains. A domain-invariant triple
(normalized natural frequency, normalized quality factor, damping ratio) indexes
memory entries across physically disparate domains (electrical circuits,
mechanical systems, gradient-descent optimizers, power grid generators) that
obey equivalent governing dynamics. An energy-conditioned separatrix gate
restricts retrieval to entries in the same topological energy regime, preventing
incorrect transfer across the separatrix boundary of softening nonlinear
oscillators. A curvature-profile discriminator computes cosine similarity between
geometric signatures of Koopman effective-frequency-vs-energy profiles, achieving
zero similarity between topologically distinct (hardening vs. softening) regimes.
A bifurcation-aware trust metric classifies driven nonlinear system dynamics as
periodic or chaotic using EDMD reconstruction error relative to a random-
trajectory baseline, overcoming the failure of spectral gap in limit-cycle
systems. An analytic Critical Clearing Time (CCT) method applies the Equal-Area
Criterion with a single universal damping correction scalar — fitted once by
ordinary least squares and invariant across generators because the product
ω₀·CCT_EAC is loading-ratio-determined — to estimate power grid transient
stability without ODE integration. Together these components achieve 2708×
warm-start speedup over cold-start optimization, 3.7× cross-domain transfer
improvement for RLC circuit optimization initialized from spring-mass mechanical
system solutions, and 57,946× CCT estimation speedup with 2.73% maximum error
across the full realistic damping range (ζ ∈ [0, 0.20]) validated on the IEEE
39-bus New England system (10 generators).
