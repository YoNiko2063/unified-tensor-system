ABSTRACT
======================================================================

Autonomous synthesis and optimization systems for programs,
physical systems, and dynamical networks require coordinated
assurance across multiple stability dimensions: structural
geometry, runtime dynamics, and regime classification.  This
invention discloses an integrated three-layer stability assurance
platform comprising a regime classification layer, a structural
synthesis layer, and a runtime validation layer, each contributing
a distinct stability condition, with cross-layer information flows
enabling coordinated feedback and adaptive reconfiguration.  A
unified stability certificate is issued only when all four
conditions are simultaneously satisfied: the structural energy
metric falls within the compilation-safe manifold, the composite
runtime robustness score exceeds a nominal threshold, the
basin-of-attraction fraction exceeds a confidence level, and
the dynamical regime derived from the runtime spectral operator
agrees with the regime label issued by the regime classification
layer.  Cross-layer information flows transmit
spectral invariant coordinates, structural feature vectors,
hardware affinity labels, and robustness scores between layers
to eliminate redundant computation and enable coordinated
convergence.  Adaptive reconfiguration protocols escalate
constraint tightening across layers when any single layer
reports failure, and trigger regime reclassification when
failure persists.  The platform applies without modification to
code synthesis, power system optimization, circuit design, and
any network of coupled dynamical systems expressible in the
generalized form C*xdot + G*x + h(x) = u(t).


======================================================================
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
======================================================================

This invention relates to integrated stability assurance systems
for autonomous synthesis and optimization, specifically to
computer-implemented multi-layer platforms that combine structural
geometric constraints, runtime spectral validation, and dynamical
regime classification in a unified feedback architecture producing
stability-certified outputs across multiple physical and
computational domains.


======================================================================
BACKGROUND
======================================================================

A. The Multi-Dimensional Stability Gap

Existing stability assurance methods address individual dimensions
of stability in isolation:

  (i)   Structural constraints (e.g., compilation manifolds,
        grammar constraints) ensure static syntactic or geometric
        validity but cannot predict runtime dynamical behavior.

  (ii)  Runtime monitoring validates dynamical stability of
        executing programs but provides no pre-execution filter
        and does not leverage structural geometry information.

  (iii) Regime classification identifies qualitative dynamical
        behavior (stable, transitional, chaotic) but is not
        connected to synthesis constraint generation or runtime
        certification.

No prior system integrates all three dimensions simultaneously
in a unified feedback architecture with cross-layer information
flows.

B. The Coordination Problem

When multiple stability assurance layers operate independently,
they produce conflicting signals and redundant computation.  A
candidate program may pass structural geometry screening but fail
runtime validation; without cross-layer coordination, the
synthesis system lacks information about which structural
modifications would improve runtime stability.  A regime
classification identifying a transitional operating point does
not automatically tighten synthesis constraints or lower the
runtime acceptance threshold.

A coordinated multi-layer platform eliminates these gaps by:

  (a) Transmitting spectral invariant coordinates from the regime
      classification layer to the synthesis layer to pre-select
      structurally compatible templates.
  (b) Transmitting structural feature vectors from the synthesis
      layer to the runtime validation layer for certificate
      traceability.
  (c) Transmitting runtime robustness scores from the validation
      layer back to the synthesis layer to tighten generation
      constraints when runtime instability is detected.
  (d) Transmitting runtime failure signals to the regime
      classification layer to trigger reclassification with
      updated trajectory data.

C. The Unified Certificate Gap

No prior system issues a single stability certificate that
simultaneously certifies:
  -- Structural compilation safety (geometric manifold criterion)
  -- Runtime dynamical stability (spectral eigenvalue criterion)
  -- Basin-of-attraction margin (Monte Carlo fraction criterion)
  -- Regime classification (locally convergent attractor
     confirmed at the operating point)

Such a unified certificate enables hardware deployment decisions
to be made from a single authoritative signal rather than
reconciling outputs from multiple independent systems.


======================================================================
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
======================================================================

The invention discloses four connected results:

(1) THREE-LAYER STABILITY ASSURANCE PIPELINE.  The platform
comprises three sequential layers with bidirectional feedback:

  Layer 1 (Regime Classification):  Constructs a linear operator
  approximation of the system at the target operating point,
  computes spectral invariant coordinates (s_1, s_2, s_3), and
  classifies the dynamical regime.  Outputs: regime label, trust
  score T, spectral coordinates, cross-domain equivalence result.

  Layer 2 (Structural Synthesis):  Receives intent specification
  and Layer 1 outputs.  Encodes candidate programs as structural
  feature vectors B, computes scalar energy metric E, and
  iteratively generates candidates within the compilation-safe
  manifold (E < D_sep_effective).  Outputs: compiled program,
  BorrowVector B, energy metric E, hardware affinity label.

  Layer 3 (Runtime Validation):  Receives compiled candidate from
  Layer 2.  Executes the candidate, collects runtime state
  trajectories, constructs a linear operator from trajectories,
  and computes composite robustness score R = min(R_1, R_2, R_3,
  R_4).  Outputs: R, basin fraction beta, certificate conditions,
  and feedback signals.

(2) CROSS-LAYER INFORMATION PROTOCOL.  Six cross-layer signals
are defined:

  S_{1->2}: Spectral coordinates (s_1, s_2, s_3) from Layer 1
    to Layer 2.  Used to pre-filter templates to those compatible
    with the system's spectral class.

  S_{1->2b}: Regime label broadcast from Layer 1 to BOTH Layer 2
    AND Layer 3.  Layer 2 uses it to set the effective energy
    threshold D_sep_effective (transitional regime applies a
    cautious offset).  Layer 3 uses it to set the effective
    minimum robustness threshold R_min_effective (transitional
    regime increases R_min by delta_R_cautious; chaotic regime
    sets R_min_effective = 1.0).

  S_{2->3}: BorrowVector B and energy E from Layer 2 to Layer 3.
    Included in certificate for full traceability.

  S_{3->2}: Robustness score R from Layer 3 to Layer 2.  If
    R < R_min_effective, Layer 2 reduces D_sep_effective and regenerates.

  S_{3->1}: Runtime trajectories and failure count from Layer 3
    to Layer 1.  Triggers regime reclassification with updated
    data when failure persists.

  S_{2->1}: Hardware affinity label from Layer 2 to Layer 1 for
    cross-domain library update.

(3) UNIFIED STABILITY CERTIFICATE.  A candidate receives a
unified stability certificate when all four conditions are
simultaneously satisfied:

    C_1: E(P) < D_sep_effective    (structural manifold)
    C_2: R(theta_0) > R_min_effective  (nominal runtime robustness)
    C_3: beta > beta_min           (basin-of-attraction fraction)
    C_4: regime_class(K_runtime) = regime_label(S_{1->2b})  (cross-layer consistency)
         where regime_label(S_{1->2b}) is the regime label transmitted
         by Layer 1 at the start of the current synthesis request

    CERT(P) = C_1 AND C_2 AND C_3 AND C_4              (Eq. 1)

The certificate record contains: program identifier, BorrowVector
B, energy E, robustness score R, basin fraction beta, spectral
coordinates (s_1, s_2, s_3), hardware affinity label, regime
label, Layer 1 trust score T, and timestamp.

(4) ADAPTIVE RECONFIGURATION.  When any layer reports failure,
the platform executes a layered reconfiguration protocol:

  Single-layer failure: tighten constraints in the failing layer
    and retry within that layer (up to N_retry iterations).

  Persistent Layer 3 failure: transmit S_{3->2} to Layer 2;
    reduce D_sep_effective; regenerate candidate from Layer 2.

  Persistent failure across Layers 2 and 3: transmit S_{3->1}
    to Layer 1; reclassify regime using runtime trajectories;
    restart pipeline from Layer 1.

  All-layer failure after reclassification: issue failure report
    with current (B, R, regime label) for operator review; do
    not issue certificate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
======================================================================

1. PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE

1.1 Overview

The integrated stability assurance platform comprises three
computational layers operating in sequential order with
bidirectional feedback signals:

  Layer 1: Regime Classification Engine (see co-pending
    application [Provisional #2])
  Layer 2: Structural Synthesis Engine (see co-pending
    application [Provisional #3])
  Layer 3: Runtime Validation Engine (see co-pending
    application [Provisional #4])

Each layer is autonomous in its internal computation but exchanges
information with adjacent layers via the cross-layer information
protocol defined in Section 2.

1.2 Layer 1 -- Regime Classification Engine

Receives: system parameters or trajectory data for the target
operating point.

Computes:
  (a) Linear operator approximation K from system representation.
  (b) Spectral decomposition: eigenvalues {lambda_i}.
  (c) Reconstruction error epsilon_rec and spectral gap gamma_gap.
  (d) Dual-criterion trust gate: trusted iff
        epsilon_rec < eta_max AND gamma_gap > gamma_min.
  (e) Spectral invariant coordinates:
        s_1 = log(omega_0), s_2 = log(Q), s_3 = zeta.
  (f) Regime label: LCA (max Re(lambda_i) < 0), transitional,
      or chaotic.
  (g) Cross-domain library query using dissonance metric d_tau.

Outputs: regime label, trust score T, spectral coordinates
(s_1, s_2, s_3), cross-domain match, Signals S_{1->2},
S_{1->2b}.

1.3 Layer 2 -- Structural Synthesis Engine

Receives: intent specification, S_{1->2} (spectral coordinates),
S_{1->2b} (regime label), S_{3->2} (robustness feedback, if
present from prior iteration).

Computes:
  (a) Template pre-filtering using S_{1->2}: retain templates
      whose structural class is compatible with received spectral
      coordinates.
  (b) Effective energy threshold:
        D_sep_effective = D_sep - delta_tighten * k_L3
      where k_L3 is the retry count received via S_{3->2} and
      delta_tighten is a step size (default 0.05 * D_sep).
      If regime label is transitional:
        D_sep_effective -= delta_cautious (default 0.10 * D_sep).
The combined effective threshold is:
    D_sep_effective = D_sep - delta_tighten * k_L3 - delta_cautious  (Eq. A)
where delta_cautious = 0 for LCA regime, delta_cautious > 0 for
transitional regime (a cautious tightening), and k_L3 is the current
Layer 3 retry counter (incremented by S_{3->2}).
  (c) Structural feature vector B(P) and energy E(P).
  (d) Geometric gradient toward compilation-safe region.
  (e) Template selection or structural modification.
  (f) Compilation of candidate.

Outputs: compiled program P, BorrowVector B(P), energy E(P),
hardware affinity label, Signal S_{2->3}.
Note: Signal S_{2->1} (hardware affinity library update) is
transmitted to Layer 1 only upon full platform certification
(CERT(P) = TRUE), not as a standard output of each synthesis
attempt.

1.4 Layer 3 -- Runtime Validation Engine

Receives: compiled candidate P, S_{2->3} (BorrowVector B,
energy E from Layer 2), S_{1->2b} (regime label from Layer 1).

Computes:
  (a) Runtime state trajectories from executing P.
  (b) Linear operator K_runtime from trajectories by
      least-squares fit.
  (c) Eigendecomposition of K_runtime.
  (d) Composite robustness score:
where the composite robustness score components are:
    R_1 = -max_i(Re(lambda_i(K_runtime)))    (stability margin)
    R_2 = |lambda_1|/|lambda_2| - 1          (spectral separation)
    R_3 = 1 - epsilon_rec/eta_max             (reconstruction fidelity)
    R_4 = 1 - max_t(V(x(t)))/E_bound         (Lyapunov energy headroom)
    R = min(R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4)              (composite robustness score)
(Details in co-pending application [Provisional #4].)
  (e) Lyapunov energy monitoring; R_4 computation.
  (f) Monte Carlo basin fraction beta using R_min_effective
      set from S_{1->2b} (Section 2.1).
  (g) Cross-layer regime consistency (C_4): classify K_runtime
      using the classification rule of co-pending application
      [Provisional #2]; compare result to regime label received
      via S_{1->2b}; C_4 = TRUE iff classifications agree.
  (h) Certificate condition check: C_2, C_3, C_4.

Outputs: R, beta, C_2/C_3/C_4, Signal S_{3->2} (if R < R_min_effective),
Signal S_{3->1} (if persistent failure exceeds N_L3_retry).


2. CROSS-LAYER INFORMATION PROTOCOL

2.1 Signal Definitions

Signal S_{1->2}:
  Content: spectral coordinates (s_1, s_2, s_3)
  Trigger: Layer 1 trust gate passed
  Action in Layer 2: filter template library to templates whose
    structural class is compatible with the received spectral
    class; set B_init to median BorrowVector of compatible
    templates.
  If Layer 1 trust gate fails: Layer 2 proceeds with default
    B_init (no pre-filtering); certificate notes Layer 1 as
    untrusted.

Signal S_{1->2b}:
  Content: regime label (LCA / transitional / chaotic)
  Trigger: Layer 1 completes (trusted or untrusted)
  Destination: Layer 2 AND Layer 3
  Action in Layer 2:
    LCA: initialize D_sep_effective = D_sep (standard threshold).
    Transitional: initialize D_sep_effective = D_sep - delta_cautious.
    Chaotic: flag to operator; Layer 2 does not synthesize
      without explicit operator override.
    In all non-chaotic cases, D_sep_effective is further reduced
    by delta_tighten per S_{3->2} retry counter k_L3, per the
    combined formula in Section 1.3(b).
  Action in Layer 3:
    LCA: use R_min_effective = R_min_default (standard).
    Transitional: R_min_effective = R_min_default +
      delta_R_cautious (default 0.05), increasing robustness
      requirement in response to proximity to bifurcation
      boundary.
    Chaotic: R_min_effective = 1.0; certificate cannot be
      issued without operator override.

Signal S_{2->3}:
  Content: BorrowVector B(P), energy metric E(P), hardware
    affinity label
  Trigger: Layer 2 produces a compiled candidate
  Action in Layer 3: include B and E in certificate fields;
    use hardware affinity to select Lyapunov basis appropriate
    to the execution target.

Signal S_{3->2}:
  Content: composite robustness score R, index of failing
    component (R_1, R_2, R_3, or R_4)
  Trigger: Layer 3 reports R < R_min_effective
  Action in Layer 2: increment retry counter k_L3; reduce
    D_sep_effective by delta_tighten; regenerate candidate.

Signal S_{3->1}:
  Content: runtime trajectory data X_runtime, failure count
  Trigger: k_L3 exceeds N_L3_retry
  Action in Layer 1: incorporate X_runtime into operator
    training data; recompute K; reissue spectral coordinates
    and regime label; restart pipeline from Layer 1.

Signal S_{2->1}:
  Content: hardware affinity label, BorrowVector B(P)
  Trigger: CERT(P) = TRUE (platform certification succeeds)
  Action in Layer 1: update cross-domain library at spectral
    coordinates (s_1, s_2, s_3) with observed affinity label.

2.2 Protocol Invariants

  (I)  Every certificate includes B, E, R, beta, (s_1, s_2, s_3),
       regime label, hardware affinity label, and timestamp.
  (II) No candidate is certified unless C_1 through C_4 are
       simultaneously satisfied.
  (III) Layer 1 reclassification via S_{3->1} is triggered at
       most once per synthesis request (prevents infinite loop).
  (IV) If Layer 1 is untrusted, Layers 2 and 3 proceed without
       spectral pre-filtering; Layer 3 applies full validation.


3. UNIFIED STABILITY CERTIFICATE

3.1 Certificate Conditions

    C_1: E(P) < D_sep_effective
         Structural manifold condition.  Verified by Layer 2.

    C_2: R(theta_0) > R_min_effective
         Nominal runtime robustness.  Verified by Layer 3.

    C_3: beta(P) > beta_min
         Basin-of-attraction fraction above confidence level.
         Verified by Layer 3.

    C_4: regime_class(K_runtime) = regime_label(S_{1->2b})
         Cross-layer regime consistency: the dynamical regime
         derived from the runtime spectral operator K_runtime
         by applying the classification rule of co-pending
         application [Provisional #2] agrees with the regime
         label issued by Layer 1 and received by Layer 3 via
         Signal S_{1->2b}.  Verified by Layer 3 by classifying
         K_runtime and comparing to the Layer 1 regime label.

The regime classification rule applied to K_runtime is: LCA if
max_i(Re(lambda_i)) < 0; Transitional if max_i(Re(lambda_i)) >= 0
and epsilon_rec < eta_max; Chaotic if epsilon_rec >= eta_max.
(Details in co-pending application [Provisional #2].)

    CERT(P) = C_1 AND C_2 AND C_3 AND C_4              (Eq. 1)

3.2 Certificate Contents

    -- Program or candidate identifier
    -- BorrowVector B(P) = (B_1, ..., B_n)
    -- Structural energy metric E(P)
    -- Composite robustness score R
    -- Basin-of-attraction fraction beta
    -- Spectral invariant coordinates (s_1, s_2, s_3)
    -- Regime label from S_{1->2b}
    -- Hardware affinity label
    -- Layer 1 trust score T
    -- Retry count history (k_L2, k_L3)
    -- Timestamp

3.3 Certificate Transfer

For a new system B spectrally equivalent to a previously certified
system A (||coords_A - coords_B|| < epsilon_equiv):

    CERT_B is issued by inheriting CERT_A without re-executing
    Layer 2, provided:
      -- coords_A and coords_B agree within epsilon_equiv.
      -- The domain mapping (co-pending [Provisional #2],
         Section 3.2) confirms cross-domain equivalence.
      -- A new Layer 3 validation is run for system B to verify
         that inherited parameters hold in the new domain.

This transfer mechanism reduces re-certification cost for
spectrally equivalent systems across physical domains.


4. ADAPTIVE RECONFIGURATION

4.1 Reconfiguration State Machine

States:

  NOMINAL: all layers operating; no failure.

  L2_RETRY: Layer 2 failed (E >= D_sep_effective or compilation
    failed); retrying within Layer 2 with gradient step.
    Counter k_L2 incremented.

  L3_RETRY: Layer 3 failed (R < R_min_effective); retrying Layer 3 with
    same candidate.  Counter k_L3 incremented.

  SYNTHESIS_TIGHTEN: S_{3->2} received; Layer 2 regenerating
    with reduced D_sep_effective.

  RECLASSIFY: S_{3->1} received; Layer 1 reclassifying with
    runtime trajectory data appended.

  FAIL: all retries exhausted or reclassification triggered
    twice; failure report issued.

4.2 State Transitions

  NOMINAL -> L2_RETRY:
    E(P) >= D_sep_effective or compilation fails.

  L2_RETRY -> L2_RETRY (self-loop):
    Gradient step applied; new candidate generated; attempt
    fails again.  k_L2 incremented each iteration.
    While k_L2 <= N_L2_retry.

  L2_RETRY -> FAIL:
    k_L2 > N_L2_retry.

  NOMINAL -> L3_RETRY:
    R < R_min_effective on first Layer 3 execution.

  L3_RETRY -> L3_RETRY (self-loop):
    Candidate re-executed; R < R_min_effective again.
    k_L3 incremented each iteration.
    While k_L3 <= N_L3_retry.

  L3_RETRY -> SYNTHESIS_TIGHTEN:
    k_L3 > N_L3_retry.

  SYNTHESIS_TIGHTEN -> L2_RETRY:
    Layer 2 regenerating; S_{3->2} applied.
    If k_L2 > N_L2_retry after tightening: -> RECLASSIFY.

  RECLASSIFY -> NOMINAL:
    Layer 1 reissues updated spectral coordinates;
    pipeline restarts from Layer 1.

  RECLASSIFY -> FAIL:
    Reclassification already triggered once (invariant III),
    or Layer 1 trust gate fails after reclassification.

  NOMINAL -> CERTIFIED (terminal success state):
    When CERT(P) = TRUE, the certified candidate exits and
    S_{2->1} is transmitted to Layer 1.

4.3 Default Parameters

    N_L2_retry  = 10   (max Layer 2 iterations per request)
    N_L3_retry  = 3    (max Layer 3 retries before tightening)
    delta_tighten   = 0.05 * D_sep per retry
    delta_cautious  = 0.10 * D_sep (transitional regime offset)
    R_min           = 0.1
    beta_min        = 0.90


5. MULTI-OBJECTIVE PARETO SURFACE

5.1 Objective Space

The platform operates in a three-dimensional objective space:

    J = (J_domain, R, E)

where:
  J_domain: domain-specific performance objective (lower is better)
  R:        composite runtime robustness score (higher is better)
  E:        structural energy metric (lower is better)

5.2 Pareto Front Construction

Only candidates satisfying CERT(P) = TRUE are admitted.
A certified candidate P dominates Q if:

    J_domain(P) <= J_domain(Q)
    AND R(P) >= R(Q)
    AND E(P) <= E(Q)

with at least one strict inequality.  The platform maintains the
Pareto front of all non-dominated certified candidates across
synthesis requests.

5.3 Solution Selection

An operator or downstream system selects from the Pareto front
using a configurable preference weight vector:

    P* = argmin_P [ w_J * J_domain(P) - w_R * R(P) +
                    w_E * E(P) ]                           (Eq. 2)

Default weights: w_J = 1.0, w_R = 0.5, w_E = 0.3.  Each Pareto
point is output with its full certificate for downstream
traceability and deployment.

      certificates, Pareto front solutions, hardware affinity
      labels, regime labels, and reconfiguration state to
      downstream deployment and operator systems.

CLAIM 1.  A computer-implemented method for stability-certified
autonomous synthesis and optimization, comprising:

  (a) receiving, by one or more processors, an intent
      specification and a target operating point for a system
      to be synthesized or optimized;
  (b) classifying, by a regime classification layer, the
      dynamical regime of the system at the target operating
      point, producing a regime label and, when a linear
      operator trust gate is satisfied, spectral invariant
      coordinates;
  (c) synthesizing, by a structural synthesis layer receiving
      the regime label and, when available, spectral invariant
      coordinates, a candidate whose structural feature vector
      satisfies a learned compilation-safe manifold criterion;
  (d) validating, by a runtime validation layer, the candidate
      by executing it and computing a composite runtime
      robustness score from spectral metrics of the runtime
      state trajectories;
  (e) issuing a unified stability certificate when the
      structural manifold criterion, the composite robustness
      score, the basin-of-attraction fraction, and the runtime
      regime classification simultaneously satisfy respective
      thresholds; and
  (f) if any condition is not satisfied, transmitting a
      cross-layer feedback signal to tighten constraints in
      the appropriate layer and regenerating the candidate.

CLAIM 2.  The method of claim 1, wherein the cross-layer
feedback signal from the runtime validation layer to the
structural synthesis layer causes the structural synthesis layer
to reduce its effective energy threshold by a step size
proportional to the number of failed runtime validation attempts,
regenerating candidates with progressively tighter structural
geometry constraints.

CLAIM 3.  The method of claim 1, wherein, when the runtime
validation retry counter exceeds its maximum threshold,
a runtime failure signal incorporating runtime state trajectories
is transmitted to the regime classification layer, which
incorporates the trajectories into its operator training data,
reissues updated spectral invariant coordinates, and causes the
structural synthesis layer to restart template pre-filtering
with the updated coordinates.

CLAIM 4.  The method of claim 1, wherein the structural synthesis
layer pre-filters a template library using the spectral invariant
coordinates received from the regime classification layer,
retaining only templates whose structural class is compatible
with the spectral class of the target operating point, and
wherein the initial structural feature vector is computed as the
median feature vector of the retained templates.

CLAIM 5.  The method of claim 1, wherein the unified stability
certificate comprises all of:

  (a) a structural manifold condition: the structural energy
      metric is below a learned effective separation boundary;
  (b) a nominal runtime robustness condition: the composite
      runtime robustness score exceeds a minimum threshold;
  (c) a basin-of-attraction condition: the fraction of parameter
      perturbations yielding composite runtime robustness score
      exceeding the minimum robustness threshold R_min_effective
      exceeds a minimum basin fraction beta_min; and
  (d) a cross-layer regime consistency condition: the dynamical
      regime derived from the runtime spectral operator by the
      runtime validation layer agrees with the regime label
      issued by the regime classification layer;
  wherein all four conditions must be simultaneously satisfied,
  and the certificate record includes the structural feature
  vector, energy metric, robustness score, basin fraction,
  spectral invariant coordinates, hardware affinity label,
  regime label, trust score, and timestamp.

CLAIM 6.  The method of claim 1, wherein the regime
classification layer outputs a transitional regime label, the
structural synthesis layer reduces its effective energy threshold
by a cautious offset, and the runtime validation layer increases
the nominal robustness threshold, collectively tightening
cross-layer constraints in response to proximity to a dynamical
bifurcation boundary.

CLAIM 7.  The method of claim 1, wherein the regime
classification layer, if its linear operator does not satisfy a
dual-criterion trust gate based on reconstruction error and
spectral gap, transmits an untrusted signal to the structural
synthesis layer, which proceeds without spectral pre-filtering
using a default structural feature vector, while the runtime
validation layer applies full validation regardless of the trust
gate outcome, and the certificate records the untrusted status
of the regime classification layer.

CLAIM 8.  The method of claim 1, wherein the method operates
across a plurality of physical and computational domains without
modification, including automated code synthesis, power system
control law synthesis, circuit component optimization, and
dynamical system parameter optimization.

CLAIM 9.  The method of claim 5, wherein the certified candidate
of claim 5 is a first candidate system having an associated
unified stability certificate, and further comprising transferring
the unified stability certificate of the first candidate system
to a second candidate system from a different physical domain
when the spectral invariant coordinates of the second candidate
system are within a tolerance of those of the first candidate
system, by inheriting the certificate fields of the first
candidate system without re-executing the structural synthesis
layer, subject to a new runtime validation of the second
candidate system.

CLAIM 10.  The method of claim 1, further comprising
constructing a multi-objective Pareto front of non-dominated
certified candidates in the space of domain performance
objective, composite runtime robustness score, and structural
energy metric, and outputting the Pareto front with associated
certificates for operator or downstream system selection.

CLAIM 11.  The method of claim 1, implemented as a finite-state
reconfiguration machine comprising at least:

  (a) a nominal state in which all three layers operate without
      failure;
  (b) a structural synthesis retry state in which the structural
      synthesis layer iterates gradient steps and template
      selection to find a candidate satisfying the effective
      energy threshold;
  (c) a runtime validation retry state in which the runtime
      validation layer re-executes the candidate under the same
      synthesis parameters;
  (d) a synthesis-tighten state in which the runtime validation
      layer has persistently failed and the structural synthesis
      layer regenerates with a reduced energy threshold;
  (e) a reclassification state in which persistent failure across
      synthesis and validation triggers updated regime
      classification using runtime trajectory data; and
  (f) a failure state in which all retries are exhausted and
      a failure report is issued without a stability certificate;
  wherein transitions between states are governed by layer
  failure conditions and retry count thresholds; and
  wherein the structural synthesis retry state and the runtime
  validation retry state each include a self-loop transition
  triggered by repeated failure within that state, incrementing
  a respective retry counter on each iteration, and transitioning
  to the next escalation state only when the retry counter
  exceeds its maximum.

CLAIM 12.  A system for integrated stability-certified synthesis
and optimization, comprising:

  (a) a memory storing intent specifications, trajectory data,
      spectral coordinates, structural feature extractors, weight
      vectors, template library, runtime trajectory data, Lyapunov
      matrices, energy bounds, perturbation samples, stability
      certificates, Pareto front, and cross-domain library;
  (b) a regime classification processor configured to construct
      a linear operator approximation, evaluate a dual-criterion
      trust gate, extract spectral invariant coordinates, and
      output regime labels and cross-layer signals;
  (c) a structural synthesis processor configured to receive
      spectral invariant coordinates and regime labels, pre-filter
      templates, generate compilation-safe candidates, and
      transmit structural feature vectors to the runtime
      validation processor;
  (d) a runtime validation processor configured to execute
      candidates, compute composite robustness scores, perform
      Monte Carlo basin analysis, and transmit feedback signals
      to the structural synthesis and regime classification
      processors;
  (e) a reconfiguration controller implementing a finite-state
      machine that routes cross-layer signals and manages retry
      and escalation logic; and
  (f) an output interface transmitting unified stability
      certificates, Pareto front solutions, hardware affinity
      labels, and reconfiguration state to deployment and
      operator systems.

CLAIM 13.  A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing
instructions that, when executed by one or more processors,
cause the processors to:

  (a) classify the dynamical regime of a target system and
      extract spectral invariant coordinates;
  (b) synthesize a candidate whose structural feature vector
      satisfies a learned manifold criterion, using spectral
      invariant coordinates to pre-filter a template library;
  (c) execute the candidate and compute a composite runtime
      robustness score from spectral metrics of the runtime
      trajectories;
  (d) issue a unified stability certificate when structural,
      runtime robustness, basin-of-attraction, and runtime
      regime conditions are simultaneously satisfied;
  (e) if any condition fails, transmit cross-layer feedback
      signals to tighten constraints and regenerate, escalating
      to regime reclassification upon persistent failure;
  (f) construct a Pareto front of certified candidates and
      output it with associated full certificates;
  without requiring domain-specific stability proofs, exhaustive
  simulation, or separate stability assurance per layer.

CLAIM 14.  The method of claim 1, applied to a power system
network comprising a plurality of generators and loads, wherein:

  (a) the regime classification layer classifies each generator's
      operating regime from swing equation parameters and outputs
      spectral invariant coordinates corresponding to the
      generator's loading class;
  (b) the structural synthesis layer generates control law
      candidates satisfying structural manifold constraints
      compatible with the generator's spectral class;
  (c) the runtime validation layer validates closed-loop
      stability of the control laws under nominal and perturbed
      loading conditions, including N-1 contingency perturbations;
      and
  (d) the unified stability certificate is used to authorize
      deployment of the control law to the power system network
      without requiring a separate dynamic security assessment.

CLAIM 15.  The system of claim 12, wherein the three processors
communicate via a cross-layer signal bus implementing exactly six
signals S_{1->2}, S_{1->2b}, S_{2->3}, S_{3->2}, S_{3->1}, and

ABSTRACT OF THE DRAWINGS
======================================================================

FIG. 1 depicts the three-layer platform architecture.  Layer 1
(Regime Classification), Layer 2 (Structural Synthesis), and
Layer 3 (Runtime Validation) are shown as horizontal bands
stacked vertically.  Forward signals S_{1->2} and S_{2->3} are
shown as downward arrows.  Feedback signals S_{3->2} and S_{3->1}
are shown as upward arrows to their respective destination layers.
Signal S_{2->1} (library update, triggered at CERT=TRUE) is shown
as a thin upward arrow from Layer 2 to Layer 1.  The unified
stability certificate exits at the bottom right.

FIG. 2 depicts the cross-layer information protocol as a six-row
table.  Columns: signal identifier, source layer, destination
layer, content, triggering condition, action in receiving layer.

FIG. 3 depicts the unified stability certificate structure.
Certificate fields are shown as labeled boxes arranged in two
groups: condition group (C_1 through C_4 with pass/fail
indicators) and traceability group (BorrowVector B, spectral
coordinates (s_1, s_2, s_3), energy E, robustness score R,
basin fraction beta, hardware affinity label, regime label, trust
score T, timestamp).  An all-conditions-satisfied indicator
(CERT = TRUE) is shown when all four C fields are satisfied.

FIG. 4 depicts the adaptive reconfiguration state machine.
States NOMINAL, L2_RETRY, L3_RETRY, SYNTHESIS_TIGHTEN,
RECLASSIFY, and FAIL are shown as nodes.  Directed transitions
are labeled by failure conditions (E >= D_sep, R < R_min_effective,
k_L2 > N_L2_retry, k_L3 > N_L3_retry) and success conditions
(CERT = TRUE).

FIG. 5 depicts the multi-objective Pareto surface.  Three axes:
domain performance J_domain (horizontal), robustness score R
(depth), structural energy E (vertical).  Non-dominated certified
candidates are shown as solid points connected by the Pareto
front curve.  Dominated or uncertified candidates are shown as
hollow points.  Example weight vector P* selection shown as a
dashed ray from the origin to the selected Pareto point.
